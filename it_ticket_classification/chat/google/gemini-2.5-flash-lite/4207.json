The key is to distill the meaning of \"annual leave request\" from the text and map it to one of the defined categories. I need to output a JSON object with a single key \"category\" and the correct category as its value. So far, the phrase \"annual leave request\" suggests that it might be an HR related task.\n\n\n**Narrowing the Classification**\n\nI've refined my approach to categorize the IT ticket. Initial analysis identified \"HR Support\" as the likely category. Now, I'm focusing on the ticket's specific phrases, such as \"annual leave request\" and \"view teams remaining annual leave allowance,\" which strongly support an HR-related classification. My output will be a JSON object with \"category\" as the key and \"HR Support\" as the value.\n\n\n"
