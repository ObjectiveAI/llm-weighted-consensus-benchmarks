Right now, I'm leaning toward either \"Hardware\" or \"Storage,\" but the precise context is still unclear. I need more information to confidently decide.\n\n\n**Evaluating Data Backup Issue**\n\nI've honed in on the ticket's core problem: data recovery, specifically around resource access for data protection. The phrases \"recovery points\" and \"protection\" are key. While \"Access\" is a possibility, \"Storage\" seems the most appropriate category. The inability to access resources hints at a deeper storage-related issue.\n\n\n**Defining Storage Problem**\n\nI've further analyzed the ticket's language: \"recovery points\" and \"protection\" are essential clues. The problem revolves around access to cluster resources *for data protection*. While access is relevant, the core issue is the **unprotected data** stemming from resource accessibility issues. \"Storage\" is the clear winner. The other categories, like \"Hardware\", or \"Access,\" while tangentially related, fail to capture the central function: backing up, recovering, and protecting the data. The data source and associated resources cannot be utilized for the protection tasks.\n\n\n"
