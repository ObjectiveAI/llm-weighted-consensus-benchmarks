However, I'll need to consider other factors mentioned in the ticket description and compare this to other options before finalizing.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've been analyzing the ticket's text, zeroing in on \"need cables\" as the central request. The surrounding text appears to be boilerplate or unrelated. My conclusion is firm: the core issue is hardware-related. Therefore, I'm confident categorizing the ticket as \"Hardware\" is correct.\n\n\n"
