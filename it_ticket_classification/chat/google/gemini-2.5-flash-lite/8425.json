The goal is to successfully map user text to predefined categories. The main task involves analyzing and understanding the provided text.\n\n\n**Mapping Text to Categories**\n\nI'm now identifying key phrases within the user's text to determine the appropriate IT ticket category. The text, seemingly about a password change, needs categorization. Currently, \"change password\" is a leading indicator, but further analysis is ongoing to ascertain the context within the supported categories.\n\n\n**Assigning the Ticket**\n\nI've analyzed the user's text, identifying key phrases such as \"change password for external user\" and \"password expire days.\" These phrases strongly suggest the ticket relates to user accounts. After evaluating against the available categories, \"Access\" emerges as the most suitable fit, encompassing password changes and user access management, while other categories are irrelevant. My final conclusion is to assign this ticket to the \"Access\" category.\n\n\n"
