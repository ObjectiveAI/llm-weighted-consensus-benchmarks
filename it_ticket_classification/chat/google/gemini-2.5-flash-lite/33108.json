I've noted keywords like \"full permissions request\" and \"permissions approved,\" which strongly point towards the \"Access\" category. My current thought process is to confirm if \"Access\" is the most precise fit, or if the context suggests a more specific classification like \"Administrative rights.\"\n\n**Selecting IT Ticket Category**\n\nI'm processing an IT ticket focused on permission adjustments. Keywords like \"full permissions request,\" \"permissions approved,\" and mentions of \"groups\" and \"owners\" strongly indicate the \"Access\" category is the most suitable fit. I'm confirming this is the best primary classification.\n\n"
