The text references \"costs\" and \"even code cost,\" leading me to consider \"Purchase\" or possibly \"Internal Project\" as the most fitting categories, as opposed to hardware or access-related issues.\n\n**Investigating Ticket Costs**\n\nI'm currently focusing on the \"costs\" mentioned in the ticket, trying to pinpoint whether they relate to a \"Purchase\" or an \"Internal Project.\" The phrase \"even code cost\" strongly suggests a financial transaction or allocation, making \"Purchase\" a prime candidate, though \"Internal Project\" remains a possibility.\n\n**Exploring Ticket Costs**\n\nI'm currently analyzing the ticket's content, focusing on the mention of \"costs\" and \"even code cost.\" This leads me to strongly consider the \"Purchase\" category, as it most directly addresses financial expenditure, although \"Internal Project\" remains a secondary consideration.\n\n**Classifying IT Expenditures**\n\nI'm currently refining the categorization of the IT ticket, with a strong focus on the mention of \"costs\" and \"even code cost.\" This leads me to lean towards the \"Purchase\" category, as it most accurately reflects the financial nature of the inquiry.\n\n"
