The key is to accurately map the provided text to the best-fit category from the list. I've read the ticket description and need to decide if it's a hardware issue, HR support, access-related, miscellaneous, storage, purchase-related, an internal project, or an administrative rights request. The phrase \"other user credentials are automatically used when trying to log\" hints at an access-related issue.\n\n\n**Evaluating HR & Access**\n\nI'm now evaluating whether the issue is primarily HR-related or a straightforward access problem. The \"starter request\" leans toward HR, but the core issue is the incorrect credentials preventing system access. While HR might be involved in initial setup, the current problem appears to be a direct access issue.\n\n\n**Narrowing Access Issue**\n\nI'm now narrowing in on the access issue, focusing on the core problem: incorrect credentials preventing login. While HR's involvement is relevant, the immediate issue is an access problem. The \"starter request\" is contextual, suggesting a possible onboarding error. The primary concern is resolving the credential issue so the employee can log in. This still points to an Access ticket with possible HR Support implications.\n\n\n**Defining Primary Category**\n\nI'm now defining the primary category for this ticket. After considering both Access and HR Support, I've decided the core issue is an Access problem. The core issue is that the user can't log in with their correct credentials. The \"starter request\" is context, suggesting an onboarding issue, but the immediate problem is access.\n\n\n**Determining Root Cause**\n\nThe ticket's problem centers on access, not HR's process. The \"other credentials\" issue indicates a login problem, more directly an access misconfiguration than a setup failure. While new employee context hints at HR involvement, the technical issue, the incorrect login, dominates. Therefore, I'm prioritizing Access as the main category, acknowledging potential HR Support implications.\n\n\n"
