The phrasing around acquiring monitor stands strongly suggests \"Purchase\". This also could be related to \"HR Support\", but I need more details to confirm that. I'm leaning toward \"Purchase\" as the primary category.\n\n\n**Narrowing Ticket Classification**\n\nI've got a much clearer picture. The repeated mention of \"monitor stands\" and the phrases like \"how to order\" and \"obtain\" are solid cues. It points directly to a \"Purchase\" ticket type. While \"HR Support\" could be a secondary consideration, the core intent is hardware acquisition. I'm feeling confident in this classification.\n\n\n"
