This strongly indicates the issue falls under access-related problems. I'm now narrowing down the most precise sub-category within \"Access\" if applicable, though the core problem is clear.\n\n**Selecting the Category**\n\nI've analyzed the ticket's language, focusing on repeated references to credential prompts, login failures, and password complexity issues. This clearly indicates the core problem is related to user authentication. Based on this, I've determined \"Access\" is the most fitting category.\n\n"
