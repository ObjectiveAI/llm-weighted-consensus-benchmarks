The phrases \"access card\", \"card still work\", and \"activate card\" are central to the issue. I'm leaning heavily towards \"Access\" as the most relevant category because these all relate to access and access-related issues. I am going to try the category \"Access\" for the first response to the user.\n\n\n**Focusing on \"Access\"**\n\nI'm solidifying my rationale for selecting \"Access\". The ticket text is all about access cards \u2013 whether they work, need activation, etc. While other categories might touch on related aspects, the core issue is direct access. \"Access\" perfectly encapsulates the problem, and ensures the relevant team handles the ticket.\n\n\n"
