I need to make a solid choice before I can move on, as I don't want to leave the ticket in the wrong pile!\n\n\n**Finalizing the Classification**\n\nI've reviewed the ticket content again and, despite the initial hesitation, I'm confident the primary focus aligns with \"HR Support\". The \"annual leave\" request clearly falls under this umbrella. While \"access\" was a consideration, it's not the core issue. I'm ready to assign this ticket the \"HR Support\" category and move on to the next one.\n\n\n"
