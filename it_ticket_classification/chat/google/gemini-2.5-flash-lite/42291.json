This first pass suggests a few possibilities, but I need to consider all available options before reaching a definitive conclusion.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've been analyzing the ticket's text, identifying key phrases like \"access denied\" and \"HR context.\" The focus is now on mapping these elements to the available categories. The repeated mention of \"Human Resources\" points to \"HR Support\" as a possible fit, but the core access issue might suggest \"Access\" as a better option. I'm carefully weighing which category best encapsulates the reported problem. My analysis also considers system functionality related aspects.\n\n\n**Focusing on Access Issues**\n\nI've honed in on the central issue: \"access denied.\" The user's struggle to submit and save feedback, coupled with the explicit \"access denied\" error, solidifies \"Access\" as the most relevant category. The HR context adds an important layer, but the root problem is a technical access restriction. I'm now certain this issue should be categorized under \"Access.\"\n\n\n**Defining Access Issues**\n\nI've carefully reviewed the ticket content again. The central issue remains the \"access denied\" error. While the HR context is present, the core problem lies in the technical inability to save and submit feedback. I'm confident in categorizing this under \"Access\". This issue directly reflects a problem caused by the system denying the user's attempt to access or modify data, regardless of the system's focus.\n\n\n"
