So far, \"HR Support\" seems like a strong contender based on the prevalent theme. I'm also considering potential overlaps with other potential categories and looking at which is the best fit.\n\n\n**Analyzing Category Relevance**\n\nI've been meticulously examining the ticket's text, identifying key phrases such as \"maternity leave\" and \"access card.\" My analysis suggests a strong connection to \"HR Support\" due to the core issue revolving around employee leave procedures and access for an employee on leave. While \"Access\" is a possibility, the context strongly points to an HR-related concern. I am leaning towards \"HR Support\" as the more accurate category.\n\n\n**Determining Final Category**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's text, especially the recurring references to \"maternity leave,\" \"access card,\" and \"maternity form,\" and decided that \"HR Support\" is the most appropriate category, given the context. Though \"Access\" is relevant, the core issue stems from an HR-related matter, namely leave management and associated access needs. This context makes HR Support the more specific choice.\n\n\n"
