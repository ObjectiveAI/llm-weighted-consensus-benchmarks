The phrase \"new starter\" jumps out, pointing me towards a potential match. I'm carefully considering other words and phrases in the ticket to validate my initial assessment, and eliminate potential false positives. I'm also ensuring the correct category will include the keywords provided.\n\n\n**Refining Category Choices**\n\nI'm now prioritizing the most relevant categories. Based on \"new starter\" and \"fill starter form,\" I'm leaning heavily towards \"HR Support.\" \"Access\" is also a possibility, as new starters often need system access, but the ticket's emphasis is on the onboarding process more broadly. I'm discarding \"Hardware,\" \"Storage,\" and \"Purchase\" as there's no evidence of those needs, and \"Miscellaneous\" seems too broad given the specific clues. I'm focusing on the subtle nuances to pinpoint the best fit.\n\n\n**Analyzing the Core Request**\n\nI've determined that the primary request is for a \"new starter\" and the need to \"fill a starter form,\" both of which align closely with HR's responsibilities. While system access will be necessary later, the core issue is the initial onboarding stage, which falls under HR.\n\n\n"
