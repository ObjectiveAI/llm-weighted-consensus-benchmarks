                    "reasoning": "**Assessing Ticket Purpose**\n\nI'm currently trying to understand the core intent of this IT ticket. I'm focusing on keywords like \"check\" and \"submission type\" to determine the most fitting category from the list.  My goal is to quickly pinpoint the primary issue before assigning a category.\n\n\n**Categorizing the IT Ticket**\n\nI've been analyzing the text, looking for the underlying problem. Key phrases like \"submission type,\" \"net members,\" \"weekly flow,\" and \"holidays\" are jumping out. I believe the ticket is about access or permissions related to a submission system, possibly HR or Administrative in nature. I'm leaning toward Access as a suitable category at the moment, but am still working through the finer details.\n\n\n**Analyzing Access Issues**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on this ticket's core function. I'm seeing this is very likely related to \"Access\" or potentially \"Administrative Rights\". The details are pointing to permissions, submission flows, and potentially HR-related data or processes. Given the recurring keywords such as \"submission type\", \"net members\" and \"holidays\", the ticket seems centred on managing user roles or permissions within a system, strongly suggesting an access-based issue.\n\n\n**Deciding on Ticket Category**\n\nI've been debating the best category. Analyzing this IT ticket text again, I'm leaning heavily towards \"Administrative rights\" or simply \"Access.\" Phrases like \"removing codes,\" \"verifying persons,\" and \"make changes\" point to managing user permissions or system configurations. \"Administrative rights\" sounds like the most precise fit for tasks related to granting, modifying, or revoking access to different system functions. I will need to verify with the end user if appropriate.\n\n\n**Defining the Core Purpose**\n\nI'm now fully immersed in understanding the purpose here. Considering the details, I have made a decision and settled on the best category for this request. The combination of phrases points clearly to administrative-level actions. I am ready to determine the correct category.\n\nI am leaning towards \"Administrative rights\" because the activities described involve managing users, system configuration, and data workflows. My focus is on determining if the user needs to \"make changes\" to the system, especially \"holiday\" approvals or to specific \"net members\".\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've been going through the IT ticket text very closely.  Keywords such as \"submission flow\" and \"removing codes\" keep jumping out at me, pointing toward a system management issue. The details point to configuration and rights, not simple access.  This makes me think  \"Administrative rights\" is the most appropriate category, based on the text. I am confident in this decision.\n\n\n**Categorizing Ticket Details**\n\nI'm now concluding my thought process. By weighing \"Access\" and \"Administrative Rights,\" I've decided this request leans towards the latter. \"Removing codes,\" \"submission flow,\" and the ability to \"make changes\" sound like tasks requiring an admin-level user. Given the information available, I believe \"Administrative rights\" is the most appropriate.\n\n\n"
