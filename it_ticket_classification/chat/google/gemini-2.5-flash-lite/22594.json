My focus is on extracting keywords and phrases to align with the provided enum options. I'm leaning towards \"Hardware\" or \"Miscellaneous\" based on initial indicators.\n\n**Estimating Resource Costs**\n\nI'm refining my categorization based on the ticket's emphasis on cost estimation for virtual machines and hardware. While \"Hardware\" remains a strong contender due to explicit mentions of CPU and hard disks, the core of the request seems to be financial projection.\n\n**Refining Ticket Categorization**\n\nI'm now closely analyzing the emphasis on \"cost estimation\" in relation to virtual machines and hardware. While \"Hardware\" remains a strong candidate due to specific component mentions, the underlying theme appears to be financial forecasting for resources, which could lead to a \"Purchase\" or \"Internal Project.\"\n\n**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI'm currently analyzing the provided ticket text to pinpoint the most accurate category. My focus is on identifying key phrases that align with the available options, with a strong inclination towards \"Hardware\" or potentially \"Purchase\" based on the emphasis on cost estimation for virtual machines and physical components.\n\n**Estimating IT Resource Costs**\n\nI'm currently refining my interpretation of the ticket's core request. While \"Hardware\" remains a strong contender due to explicit mentions of virtual machines, CPUs, and hard disks, I'm giving more weight to the \"cost estimation\" aspect. This emphasis could steer the categorization towards financial planning or resource allocation, potentially aligning with \"Purchase\" or \"Internal Project.\"\n\n**Estimating IT Resources**\n\nI'm currently refining my understanding of the ticket's core request. While \"Hardware\" remains a strong contender due to explicit mentions of virtual machines, CPUs, and hard disks, I'm placing more emphasis on the \"cost estimation\" aspect. This focus might ultimately lead to a categorization centered on financial planning or resource allocation, potentially aligning with \"Purchase\" or \"Internal Project.\"\n\n**Forecasting Resource Expenditures**\n\nI'm currently focused on the nuances of cost estimation for virtual machines and hardware components. While \"Hardware\" is a strong contender given the explicit mentions of CPU and hard disks, I'm giving increased weight to the \"cost estimation\" aspect, suggesting a potential alignment with financial planning or resource acquisition.\n\n**Analyzing IT Resources**\n\nI'm currently focused on categorizing the IT ticket. The text emphasizes cost estimation for virtual machines and hardware components like CPU and hard disk. While \"Hardware\" is a strong contender due to direct mentions, I'm weighing the \"cost estimation\" aspect more heavily, considering its potential link to financial planning or future acquisition.\n\n**Focusing on Resource Costs**\n\nI'm now dedicating my analysis to the core request for cost estimation. While explicit mentions of virtual machines, CPUs, and hard disks initially pointed towards \"Hardware,\" I'm giving greater weight to the financial planning aspect. This suggests a potential shift towards \"Purchase\" or \"Internal Project.\"\n\n**Estimating IT Resources**\n\nI'm currently focusing on the core request for cost estimation.
