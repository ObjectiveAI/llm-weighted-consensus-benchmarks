After analyzing the provided content, which discusses limited drive space, I've concluded that the \"Hardware\" category is the most appropriate. The user's request explicitly concerns storage capacity, so my analysis leads me to label the IT ticket accordingly.\n\n\n**Identifying Appropriate Category**\n\nMy analysis of the IT ticket has led me to firmly settle on \"Storage\" as the correct categorization. The user's description, particularly the mentions of limited space and file deletion due to capacity issues, leaves no room for doubt. I've ruled out \"Hardware\", as the underlying issue is the consumption of space, not a physical hardware malfunction. The ticket's content clearly points towards storage constraints as the core problem.\n\n\n"
