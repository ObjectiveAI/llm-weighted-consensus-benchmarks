The phrases \"oracle issues\" and \"report appears\" strongly suggest a problem with Oracle's reporting functionality. I am leaning towards categorizing this as a software-specific issue, potentially related to system functionality rather than general access or hardware.\n\n**Assigning IT Ticket Category**\n\nI've analyzed the provided IT ticket text, which mentions \"oracle issues\" and a \"report appears\". While it's not a perfect fit for any single category, I'm currently leaning towards \"Miscellaneous\" as the most appropriate classification, as the issue doesn't clearly align with Hardware, HR Support, Access, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, or Administrative rights.\n\n**Assigning Ticket Category**\n\nI've analyzed the ticket's mention of \"oracle issues\" and \"report appears.\" Given the provided categories, I'm leaning towards classifying this as \"Miscellaneous\" as it doesn't clearly fit into Hardware, HR, Access, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, or Administrative rights, acting as the most appropriate catch-all for this software-related query.\n\n"
