The keywords are pointing towards leave-related issues. I'm focusing on the \"leave\" terms and other context clues to decide between \"HR Support\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" The absence of any explicit hardware, access, or purchase requests is notable.\n\n\n**Defining Ticket Scope**\n\nI've refined my initial analysis and pinpointed the core issue: the \"leave submitting error.\" The terms \"annual leave\" and \"el care leave\" solidify the HR connection. While there's a slight possibility of access issues, the focus seems to be on the *process* of leave requests. I'm leaning heavily towards \"HR Support\" for the primary category, with potential for a secondary note about related systems if there's an error.\n\n\n**Clarifying the Core Issue**\n\nI've just finished a deeper dive into the ticket text. My initial impression of \"HR Support\" still holds strong. I focused on the repeated \"leave\" and the phrases like \"leave submitting error.\" Now, I'm thinking about the \"se si task details\" section. While a system could be involved, the central problem seems to be an error related to the *process* of requesting leave. \"El care leave\" further solidifies the HR nature of the issue.\n\n\n\n"
