I'm focusing on \"recurrent meetings,\" \"active calendar problem,\" and \"cannot cancel\" to pinpoint the most suitable category. Currently, I'm leaning toward \"Access\" or potentially \"Miscellaneous,\" but need to ensure the best fit.\n\n\n**Finalizing the best fit**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the ticket details. Based on the symptoms described (recurrent meetings, inability to cancel/join, visibility problems, and permissions), \"Access\" is looking like the clear winner. The keywords strongly suggest calendar access issues, more than administrative rights. \"Miscellaneous\" seems too broad. So, I'm confident about \"Access\" being the most appropriate.\n\n\n**Reaching a decision**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's symptoms: recurrent meetings, inability to cancel/join, visibility problems, and granted permissions. These point directly toward calendar access or configuration. While \"Administrative rights\" touched on permissions, the core issue is meeting functionality, best captured by \"Access.\" After weighing options, I'm confident \"Access\" is the most accurate category, focusing on the calendar's operational aspects. I'll finalize this.\n\n\n"
