The provided text, \"issue with automatic mail notifications from service,\" immediately suggests a few possibilities. Access seems likely, as this could involve permission issues, or perhaps it's related to the email infrastructure and falls under a more general \"Miscellaneous\" category. I am still considering.\n\n\n**Categorizing the System Issue**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and the available categories. The automatic email notifications issue, described as \"issue with automatic mail notifications from service now sent thursday\", is giving me some pause. It's not a clear fit for Hardware, HR, Access, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, or Administrative rights. While \"Miscellaneous\" seems broad, I'm leaning toward it as the most applicable.  I'm still exploring if there's an indirect connection to \"Access\" but it feels like a stretch. The duplication and delay, though system-related, are not strictly about the typical access controls.\n\n\n**Defining the IT Problem**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's text, specifically focusing on the duplicate and delayed email notifications from ServiceNow. \"Issue with automatic mail notifications\" is clearly the crux of it. The delays cause the caller confusion, suggesting it's system-related, but the specific cause doesn't fit any other category. Although a system malfunction, it's not strictly \"Access\", \"Storage\", \"Hardware\" or other specific categories. \"Miscellaneous\" is starting to feel increasingly accurate, given the core problem is a system malfunction related to email notifications, not any other category.\n\n\n"
