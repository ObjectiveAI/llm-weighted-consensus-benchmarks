I'm also considering \"Miscellaneous\" but it seems less precise given the hardware-specific details.\n\n\n**Focusing on Audio Issues**\n\nI've honed in on \"Hardware\" as the definitive category. The text consistently points towards malfunctioning audio equipment, solidifying this choice over \"Miscellaneous\" or other options. The problem is definitively with the physical audio setup in the meeting room, not a broader, unrelated issue.\n\n\n"
