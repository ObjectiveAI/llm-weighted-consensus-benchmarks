I'm trying to identify the most relevant terms and phrases within the ticket to determine the appropriate classification.\n\n\n**Evaluating Integration Scenarios**\n\nI'm now diving deeper into the ticket's core intent. My initial analysis points toward an \"Internal Project\" classification, due to the integration focus. However, I need to consider potential overlaps, specifically with \"Access\" related to mailbox integration, and maybe \"Storage\" for log management concerns. The mention of sensitive client information adds another layer of complexity. Further refinement is necessary to pinpoint the primary driver behind this integration.\n\n\n**Determining Ticket Priority**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the best category: \"Internal Project\". The emphasis is on building an integration, and not simply accessing data or storage.  I've taken note that I need to ensure  this matches the ticket intent rather than simply considering surface details of the text. The keywords like \"action plan\" and \"rollout\" reinforce my decision of an internal project.\n\n\n**Defining Project Scope**\n\nI've determined \"Internal Project\" as the best fit. I'm now refining the scope within that category, to fully capture the ticket's nuances. It's more than just an integration; it's a project to enhance data security and compliance via a new process. I'm noting that the sensitive data element is central, and this might require additional context from the schema.\n\n\n"
