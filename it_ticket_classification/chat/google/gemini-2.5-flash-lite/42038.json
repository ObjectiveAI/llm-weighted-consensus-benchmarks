The text is brief and somewhat fragmented, making the analysis tricky. I've considered the phrases, \"nor working\", \"tried connect\", and \"but fails\" to deduce the problem. The goal is to choose the best fit from \"Hardware\", \"HR Support\", \"Access\", \"Miscellaneous\", \"Storage\", \"Purchase\", \"Internal Project\", and \"Administrative rights.\"\n\n\n**Defining the Optimal Category**\n\nI've honed in on the issue, which appears to be access-related. The phrase \"tried connect but fails\" and the explicit need for \"access\" firmly point towards \"Access\" as the primary category. While administrative rights might be involved, \"Access\" covers the broader problem of connection and permission. Considering the limited context, this seems to be the most accurate categorization for this IT ticket.\n\n\n"
