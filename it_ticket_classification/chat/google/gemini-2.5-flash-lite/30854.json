So far, \"add vc unit,\" \"booking,\" and \"Outlook\" stand out, potentially pointing toward Hardware, Access, or HR Support, but the context is still unclear. I'm focusing on these keywords to narrow down the possible categories and ensure the appropriate resolution.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down Categories**\n\nCurrently, I'm focusing on \"Hardware\" as the primary category, with \"Purchase\" as a possible secondary due to the \"unit form order\" mention. The repeated appearance of \"vc unit,\" \"booking,\" and \"installation\" strongly suggests a hardware setup request. I'm prioritizing hardware setup issues. Networking also seems related to Hardware.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the ticket text, zeroing in on \"vc unit,\" \"booking,\" and \"networking.\" These keywords consistently surface, strongly indicating a hardware-related issue, specifically the installation and setup of a video conferencing unit. I've ruled out HR Support, Access, and the other less relevant categories. The focus is now on hardware configuration.\n\n\n"
