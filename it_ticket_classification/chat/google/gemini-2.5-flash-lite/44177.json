The issue with accessing files and being prompted for credentials leans toward \"Access\" being the best fit from the provided options. This seems to be the most critical element of the ticket. I am double-checking to ensure no further information may change this analysis.\n\n\n**Evaluating Access Concerns**\n\nI've been analyzing the ticket's specifics to confirm the \"Access\" category. The credential prompts and inability to open locations are central to the issue. I am now exploring if the \"large files\" aspect adds another layer; however, the primary problem remains accessing these files in the first place, reinforcing \"Access\" as the best fit.\n\n\n**Finalizing Category Selection**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's details. The recurring credential prompts and the inability to access a location are the most defining elements. While large file sizes impact usage, the core problem remains access. This reinforces \"Access\" as the most appropriate category, rather than \"Storage\" because the immediate issue is gaining entry, not the capacity or performance of the storage itself. I'm satisfied that \"Access\" accurately reflects the user's predicament.\n\n\n"
