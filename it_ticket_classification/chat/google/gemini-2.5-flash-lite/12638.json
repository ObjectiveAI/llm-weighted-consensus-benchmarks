The keywords seem sparse, making this challenging. \"New starter\" suggests a potential fit for \"HR Support\" or perhaps \"Access,\" depending on the context. The other keywords don't offer much clarity so far. I'll need to look for implied context to make a determination.\n\n\n**Defining Ticket's Scope**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and am leaning towards \"Access\" as the best fit. While \"HR Support\" has an initial connection, the actual *task* described is about creating system credentials, which is purely an IT function. The core phrase, \"create his credentials,\" strongly points to access management, not HR-related onboarding. The other categories don't align with the ticket's specifics. I think I'm solidifying the decision.\n\n\n**Solidifying Ticket Category**\n\nI'm now fully confident that \"Access\" is the correct category. The key phrase, \"create his credentials,\" is definitively tied to access management. The surrounding context, though initially suggesting HR, ultimately points to an IT-driven task. \"HR Support\" is responsible for the employee, but the explicit *action* - credential creation - is IT's domain, making the other categories unsuitable.\n\n\n"
