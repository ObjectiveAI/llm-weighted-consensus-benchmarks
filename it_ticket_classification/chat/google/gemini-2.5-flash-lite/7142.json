Though HR is involved with onboarding, this leans more towards technical setup than HR policy. I'm focusing on \"Access\" as the primary category, with a potential secondary tag for \"HR Support\" if necessary.\n\n\n**Refining Ticket Categorization**\n\nI've refined my initial assessment. The provided text, despite seeming to involve HR due to the \"new starter\" context, emphasizes IT provisioning tasks. Specifically, the phrases \"credentials,\" \"display name,\" and \"user prompted changing\" highlight the core need for access setup. Therefore, I'm leaning heavily towards \"Access\" as the primary category, with the possibility of tagging it as \"HR Support\" if the system allows for multiple classifications. The focus shifted from HR's involvement in the new hire to the technical details of enabling the employee's system access.\n\n\n**Determining Primary Focus**\n\nI'm now fully committed to \"Access\" as the core category. I've re-examined the text in detail, focusing on the crucial phrases like \"credentials,\" \"display name,\" and \"user prompted changing\". While \"new starter\" suggests HR involvement, the technical tasks described clearly fall under IT access provisioning. I'm certain that the ticket is best classified under \"Access,\" reflecting the primary action required: user setup and account access.\n\n\n"
