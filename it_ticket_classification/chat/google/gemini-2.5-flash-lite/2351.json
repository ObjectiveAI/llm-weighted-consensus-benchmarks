I'm leaning toward \"Access\" since it seems related to managing access rights post-employee departure. I'm still considering other categories, but this seems the most likely fit.\n\n\n**Defining the Ticket Type**\n\nI'm now carefully evaluating the \"HR Support\" category, as well as the \"Access\" and \"Administrative Rights\" options, which are the most relevant. While \"Access\" could apply, the context of a departing employee makes \"HR Support\" a strong contender. However, since the user is likely asking to get administrative access to remove a mailbox after they have already left, \"Administrative Rights\" and \"Access\" are possible. I'm weighing the nuances to select the best fit.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Ticket Classification**\n\nMy current focus is on prioritizing \"HR Support\" as the main category for this ticket. The emphasis on a departing employee strongly suggests an HR-driven process. While \"Access\" is relevant, the context leans more towards an HR-initiated action. I've re-evaluated the alternatives, and the trigger of the mailbox removal (employee departure) aligns better with \"HR Support\". The ticket text makes this clear, so the case for \"HR Support\" is strengthened.\n\n\n"
