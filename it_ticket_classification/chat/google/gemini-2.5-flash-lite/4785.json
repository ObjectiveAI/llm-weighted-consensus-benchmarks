I'm leaning toward \"Purchase\" due to the requisition aspect, but \"Miscellaneous\" remains a possibility given the information request. I'm weighing these options now.\n\n\n**Determining Purchase Intent**\n\nI've taken a deep dive into the keywords from the ticket description, considering \"approve requisition,\" \"costs,\" and \"amount\" as critical indicators. The phrases \"paid actions,\" \"requester paid,\" and \"submitted\" further reinforce this. \"Purchase\" feels like the most accurate fit compared to the other options. I'm satisfied that this is the best fit, and am preparing to finalize my recommendation.\n\n\n"
