I need to pinpoint the right category for each ticket, from options like hardware, HR, access, or storage. The goal is to develop a method that smartly suggests the optimal classification.\n\n\n**Evaluating Categorical Fit**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the best category for these tickets. I've ruled out hardware, storage, and purchase. The \"cannot submit expense report\" text points towards a system or process problem, making HR Support a prime contender. While access might be a secondary issue, the primary issue seems to be functional. \"Miscellaneous\" is a last resort.\n\n\n**Determining Ticket Origin**\n\nI'm now prioritizing the \"HR Support\" category, focusing on the core issue of an inability to submit an expense report. I've analyzed the \"charge code\" mention, which strengthens the link to finance-related processes. I'm choosing \"HR Support\" as a more precise fit than the catch-all \"Miscellaneous\". I'm considering \"Administrative rights\" a secondary factor.\n\n\n**Defining Appropriate Category**\n\nMy focus has shifted towards defining the appropriate category for the ticket. After eliminating other choices, HR Support consistently emerges as the most fitting, aligning with the core issue of expense report submission and charge code usage. I've ruled out Administrative Rights as the primary concern, focusing on the broader process dysfunction instead.\n\n\n"
