This decision stems from the clear HR-centric content involving an employee's leave, associated forms, and reporting processes. I've eliminated other options like \"Access,\" \"Hardware,\" and \"Miscellaneous\" due to their lack of direct relevance to the HR-focused information in the ticket.\n\n\n"
