The key indicators I'm working with point towards an issue related to access. Specifically, the phrases \"needs your credentials\" and \"keep entering details\" suggest a problem with access rights or authentication. I'm carefully considering whether it might also fall under \"HR Support\" if the credentials issue is related to employee access or potentially \"Administrative rights.\"\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Classification**\n\nI've honed in on the \"Access\" category for this ticket. The phrases \"needs your credentials,\" \"keep entering details,\" and \"logged out logged back\" all strongly point towards an access-related issue. This seems to be the most appropriate classification, with the other categories now appearing less relevant given this specific textual evidence.\n\n\n"
