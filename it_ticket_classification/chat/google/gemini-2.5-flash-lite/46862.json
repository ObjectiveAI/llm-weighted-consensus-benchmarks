My goal is to identify key terms that will allow me to accurately assign it to one of the predefined IT support categories. This involves careful parsing and matching against the available options.\n\n**Assigning Ticket Category**\n\nI've analyzed the ticket text, noting keywords like \"change process,\" \"line manager change request,\" and \"manager can you please correct.\" This strongly points towards HR-related operations, specifically employee lifecycle management, rather than hardware, access, or administrative issues. Therefore, I'm assigning it to \"HR Support.\"\n\n**Refining Ticket Categorization**\n\nI've been deep in thought, thoroughly examining the ticket's nuances. The phrases \"change process,\" \"line manager change request,\" and the request to \"correct\" employee status all strongly signal an HR-centric issue. My current assessment leads me to firmly categorize this as \"HR Support.\"\n\n"
