The user is requesting a new shared folder, explicitly mentioning \"storage\" and \"internship\". While there are other keywords, the emphasis is on the storage aspect of the request. I'm going to categorize it as **Storage** and see how this fares.\n\n\n**Defining Ticket Scope**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the best category. \"Storage\" is the frontrunner due to the direct request for a new shared folder and explicit mention of \"storage.\" There's a strong secondary element of \"Access\" in the request, but I think the storage aspect is dominant. I've considered all the options, but am leaning towards Storage for the classification and hoping it accurately reflects the user's intent!\n\n\n**Confirming Ticket Type**\n\nI'm now revisiting the \"Storage\" versus \"Access\" dilemma. The ticket's emphasis is on the creation and management of a new shared folder for storage, with access as a secondary, although important, component. While \"persons questions\" hinted at potential permissions, the primary objective is the *storage resource* itself. Thus, \"Storage\" seems the more accurate classification. I'm focusing on the core request: creating and handling this new \"internship\" storage. I have a definitive path now.\n\n\n"
