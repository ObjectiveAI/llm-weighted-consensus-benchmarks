I'm leaning toward \"Internal Project\" due to \"oracle project manager\" and \"pm.\" Further refinement is underway.\n\n\n**Categorizing Further Refined**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket, now considering \"Administrative rights\" more closely alongside \"Internal Project.\" Although \"change owner\" could imply right changes, the \"oracle project manager\" context continues to strongly suggest an internal project. I'm focusing on whether \"codes\" relate to project identifiers, which further reinforces the \"Internal Project\" classification. It seems less about granting specific administrative rights.\n\n\n**Defining Ticket Classification**\n\nI've re-evaluated the ticket content, focusing on the keywords. \"Oracle project manager\" and the shift in ownership direction strongly point to \"Internal Project.\" Although \"codes\" could imply different things, the project manager context takes precedence. I'm focusing on \"Internal Project\" as the appropriate classification because the request is about managing and modifying aspects of an in-progress internal project.\n\n\n"
