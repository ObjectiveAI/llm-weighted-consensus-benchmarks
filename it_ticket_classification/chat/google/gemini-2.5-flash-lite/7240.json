                    "reasoning": "**Defining Ticket Categories**\n\nI'm currently focused on defining the appropriate categories for IT tickets, specifically based on the provided text. My initial analysis involves identifying keywords like \"delete\" and \"contract variation.\" I'm now evaluating whether these keywords suggest \"Access,\" \"Purchase,\" or \"Internal Project\" as the most suitable classification for this specific ticket. I'm leaning toward \"Purchase\" because of the word \"contract\" and \"variation\".\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and I think the issues are centered around saving data and data management. It seems like the user is facing difficulties creating, saving, searching, and deleting \"contract variations\" within an existing system. The core problem appears to be related to the system's ability to handle contract data accurately and efficiently. Considering the provided list of categories, the most appropriate choice is \"Access\" because it is a system access problem.\n\n\n**Evaluating Ticket Context**\n\nI've been re-evaluating the ticket content, focusing on the core activities and the system being used. The user's actions involve creating, saving, searching, and deleting \"contract variations\" within an application. While \"Internal Project\" could be a possibility, it seems more focused on data management and the application's functionality. My current thinking is that this might fall under \"Miscellaneous\" as the system is encountering function issues. However, I am still considering \"Purchase\" as there may be some tie-in with contracts.\n\n**Determining Final Classification**\n\nAfter deeper analysis, I've concluded that \"Miscellaneous\" is the most appropriate category. While \"Internal Project\" could be relevant if the \"contract variation\" is part of a project, the description primarily focuses on the application's functionality. The user is facing saving, duplicate, and search problems within the system. \"Miscellaneous\" best captures this kind of system function-related issue.\n\n\n**Selecting The Best Fit**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on \"Miscellaneous\" as the most suitable category. The user's trouble involves creation, saving, and deletion of contract data within a system, which suggests a broader functionality issue. While \"Internal Project\" could be a possibility, the description aligns more closely with general system function. The focus is on the software's handling of data.\n\n\n**Choosing the Default Option**\n\nI'm now fully committed to \"Miscellaneous\" as the optimal category, as no other option cleanly encompasses the described issue, which pertains to application functionality and data management, specifically within an internal software system. While \"Internal Project\" could be relevant if the \"contract variations\" are project outputs, the focus remains on system usability and data integrity, aligning best with a general \"Miscellaneous\" classification.\n\n\n**Confirming Final Selection**\n\nAfter careful re-evaluation, \"Miscellaneous\" remains the best fit. I've considered all angles, including the potential for \"Internal Project.\" However, the ticket's core issue is system functionality: saving, duplicates, and searching. It aligns best with a general \"Miscellaneous\" classification.\n\n\n**Confirming the Final Choice**\n\nI've re-evaluated the ticket description once more. The issues described involve saving data, handling duplicates, and searching, all within an application for contract variations. While \"Internal Project\" could apply if \"contract variation\" refers to an internal project deliverable, the primary focus is on system functionality. Ultimately, I'm confident that \"Miscellaneous\" is the most accurate and suitable category, given the provided options.\n\n\n"
