The text \"proposal to be removed by it sent\" provides limited information, so I'm carefully considering all possible categories. It seems the core action is related to data or information, maybe related to a request to change access or archive data, but the context is still unclear. I'm leaning toward a category that's broad enough to cover this ambiguity, but I'll continue analyzing to refine my choice before making a firm selection.\n\n\n**Identifying the Core Issue**\n\nI've analyzed the ticket text, and it's looking like an application workflow problem. Phrases like \"cannot change approval flow\" and \"delete proposal submitted\" point toward a malfunction in a system, not a simple access issue. I'm focusing on \"Internal Project\" as a potential fit since it could be a newly implemented system. However, \"Administrative rights\" also seems relevant given the user's inability to alter the flow. I need to figure out if it's workflow issue or lack of admin permissions.\n\n\n**Focusing on Permission Implication**\n\nNow, I'm focusing on the implied lack of permission. \"cannot change approval flow\" and the need for IT to \"delete proposal submitted\" signals administrative needs. I've reevaluated the categories. While \"Internal Project\" could fit a new system, the issues point toward existing application management. After careful review, \"Administrative rights\" seems to best describe the root cause: the user doesn't have the needed permissions.\n\n\n"
