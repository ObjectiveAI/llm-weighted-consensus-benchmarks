The key phrase \"bouncing not being sent to the wanted mailbox\" presents a challenge as it's not immediately obvious which category it should fall under, so I need to analyze this further. I'm considering which category this phrase most likely relates to.\n\n\n**Determining Key Indicators**\n\nI'm now identifying the most relevant keywords within the ticket text to accurately assign it to a category. It's becoming clearer that the \"bouncing\" issue points towards an Access or potentially an HR Support issue, given the email-related nature. I'm focusing on \"sent,\" \"mailbox,\" and the user's role to make a decision.\n\n\n**Pinpointing Primary Focus**\n\nI'm now identifying the most relevant keywords within the ticket text to accurately assign it to a category. The primary focus seems to be the departure of an employee, linked with communication and workflow impact. Keywords like \"bouncing,\" \"sent,\" and \"announcement\" suggest an email-related context. The presence of \"hiring\" and \"transition\" clearly leans toward an HR-related issue.\n\n\n**Clarifying Primary Category**\n\nI'm now certain the ticket belongs in **HR Support**. While email issues are present, they stem from the departure announcement, making it secondary. The primary concern is managing employee transitions, hiring processes, and organizational changes, solidly pointing to HR. The bouncing issue could be a side effect, but the core issue revolves around HR.\n\n\n"
