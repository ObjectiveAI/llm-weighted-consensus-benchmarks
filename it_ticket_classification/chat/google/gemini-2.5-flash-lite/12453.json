This strongly points towards an \"HR Support\" issue, based on the provided category list. I'm confident in this direction, so I will now work on extracting the important data to move the ticket forward.\n\n\n**Defining the Key Theme**\n\nI've determined that the \"leaver\" focus is central. Analyzing all mentions confirms this: \"leave date,\" \"leaver form,\" \"mailbox,\" \"AD rights,\" \"token,\" and more. The recurring \"leaver\" theme leads me to believe this is likely an HR-related support request, because it covers a broad range of tasks related to employees departing the company. I'm building out a strategy to identify the best action required to resolve this ticket quickly and efficiently.\n\n\n**Finalizing the Categorization**\n\nI've determined that \"HR Support\" is the optimal category, given the prevalence of \"leaver\" references throughout. The ticket centers on the workflow for departing employees. While access-related tasks are present, they are sub-components of the broader HR-driven leaver process. \"HR Support\" best captures the essence of this ticket, encompassing the need for IT assistance in managing leaver procedures. I am now proceeding with extracting key details to fulfill the request.\n\n\n"
