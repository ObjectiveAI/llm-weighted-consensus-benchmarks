While the text is brief, I've managed to identify key phrases: \"jobs red\" suggests a system error, and the mention of \"sonar removed\" and \"link sonar\" points toward a project or development-related issue, rather than HR or hardware. These details are helping to narrow down the possible category. My next step will be to explore if those keywords give any further insights.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Scope**\n\nI've been analyzing the text closely, and the focus is clearly on the technical aspects of an IT ticket. The keywords \"jobs red,\" \"sonar,\" \"installation,\" and \"build\" are consistently present. I'm leaning toward an \"Internal Project\" or, more likely, an \"Administrative Rights\" issue related to the CI/CD pipeline, and installation configurations. Further investigation is needed to be sure. My next step will be to explore any additional evidence.\n\n\n**Defining the Category**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the text, and it's become quite clear that the central issue revolves around the inability to configure or resolve an installation problem. The repeated mentions of \"installation\", and \"jobs red\" consistently point toward a permissions issue, specifically a possible lack of \"administrative rights\" needed to adjust the CI/CD tool, Sonar. I've ruled out the other categories due to the specific technical nature and focus of the ticket details. The keywords led to the conclusion.\n\n\n"
