My focus is on accurately assigning it to the correct category from the available options: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, or Administrative rights. The current ticket mentions \"service now changes july pm changes,\" which I'm evaluating for its best fit.\n\n**Categorizing Incoming Tickets**\n\nI'm refining the classification of an IT ticket. The mention of \"annual leave\" and \"returning\" strongly suggests an \"HR Support\" category, even with the initial \"ServiceNow changes\" phrasing. I'm weighing this against potential \"Access\" or \"Miscellaneous\" if the changes are system-wide, but HR appears to be the primary driver.\n\n**Classifying Ticket Data**\n\nI'm currently analyzing a new IT ticket. My focus is on discerning the core issue from the provided text to accurately assign it to the most fitting category: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, or Administrative rights. The description mentions \"annual leave\" which strongly suggests an \"HR Support\" classification.\n\n"
