So far, the keywords \"access\" and \"user\" have surfaced, suggesting a potential fit with the \"Access\" category. I'll continue to analyze the text to determine if there are other relevant keywords that refine this initial assessment or point towards a different category entirely.\n\n\n**Confirming Access Category**\n\nI've honed in on the \"Access\" category. The keywords surrounding user permissions and accessing specific files and folders strongly support this. The phrases related to \"libraries,\" \"reports,\" and \"forms\" further solidified this direction. I've ruled out \"HR Support\" because the focus is solely on file access. No other category, such as \"Hardware\" or \"Purchase,\" appears relevant.\n\n\n"
