These keywords point me towards either \"Access\" or \"HR Support,\" but I'm leaning toward \"Access\" since it mentions an \"ad center.\" I will refine this choice after looking for more clues.\n\n\n**Categorizing Access Issues**\n\nI've zeroed in on the \"Access\" category for this ticket. The \"ad center,\" coupled with \"password reset\" and \"new starter,\" solidified my choice. Initial thoughts of HR Support were superseded by the technical nature of the request, which clearly involves account management and permissions. The keywords all point towards user access. It is my firm decision.\n\n\n**Refining Category Selection**\n\nI've conducted a thorough analysis of the IT ticket text. My current focus is refining the category selection. While \"HR Support\" initially seemed relevant due to the \"new starter\" aspect, the core request is a technical one: password reset and user account management within an \"ad center.\" After careful deliberation, I'm confident that \"Access\" is the most precise and encompassing category, reflecting the primary concern of user credentialing and authorization.\n\n\n"
