My current thought process strongly leans towards categorizing this as a \"Hardware\" issue due to the focus on machine functionality.\n\n**Classifying Ticket Data**\n\nI've reviewed the ticket details and focused on the core problem: machines that are unresponsive and failing to boot, even after script issues. My analysis strongly points towards a \"Hardware\" classification due to the focus on physical machine functionality.\n\n"
