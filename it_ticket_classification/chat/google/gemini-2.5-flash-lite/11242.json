My current focus is to accurately classify this IT ticket. Based on the keywords and context, I'm leaning toward HR Support, due to the mention of \"new starter\" and \"induction\". I'm still weighing the other options to ensure the best fit.\n\n\n**Confirming the Classification**\n\nI'm now fully confident that the ticket belongs in the \"HR Support\" category. My reasoning is solid: the text clearly points to a new employee's onboarding, specifically mentioning \"new starter,\" \"starter form,\" and \"induction.\" These elements align directly with HR processes, and while some IT tasks might be involved, the primary focus is HR-related. Other categories like \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" are secondary to the core HR-centric nature of the request.\n\n\n**Revisiting Category Specifics**\n\nI'm now refining the classification further. While \"HR Support\" remains the core, I'm analyzing potential overlaps. The user mentions needing assistance with a \"return form,\" which could subtly involve IT if it's an online or digitally-completed form. However, the dominant cues, such as the \"new starter\" and \"induction\" are still very HR-centric. I'm confirming that the IT aspects, even if present, are secondary to the primary HR request.\n\n\n"
