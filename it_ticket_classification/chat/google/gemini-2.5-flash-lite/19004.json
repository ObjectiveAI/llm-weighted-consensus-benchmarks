After carefully reviewing the text, \"monitor\" appears several times, which, along with terms like \"ordering\" and \"purchase,\" suggests a hardware-related issue. My current analysis leans towards classifying this as a \"Purchase\" request, but I'm considering other possibilities before I commit.\n\n\n**Revising Category Assignment**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket, focusing on \"monitor order\" and \"ordering monitor.\" The new employee context solidified my analysis. \"Purchase\" remains the strongest fit, as it directly relates to acquiring new hardware. \"Hardware\" is too broad, and others like \"HR Support\" and \"Access\" are clearly unrelated. My latest view is that \"Purchase\" is the optimal category for this specific request.\n\n\n"
