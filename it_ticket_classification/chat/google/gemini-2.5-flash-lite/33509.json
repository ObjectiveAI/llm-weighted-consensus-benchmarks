                    "reasoning": "**Identifying Ticket Type**\n\nI'm currently focused on determining the proper category for this IT ticket. After analyzing the provided text (\"new project pas july pm re code hi\"), I'm leaning toward \"Internal Project.\" The mention of a \"new project\" seems to be the central theme, and it doesn't immediately suggest any of the other categories. I'll need to confirm this by considering any additional information.\n\n\n**Refining Category Determination**\n\nI'm now prioritizing the \"Purchase\" category.  The phrase \"purchase requests\" is a strong indicator. I previously considered \"Internal Project\" due to \"new project,\" but the explicit mention of purchase requests outweighs the project aspect. I'm focusing on the dominant theme of procurement. I need to ensure there are no overriding factors before confirming my decision.\n\n\n**Categorizing Purchase Requests**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on \"Purchase\" as the dominant category. The text highlights \"purchase requests\" extensively. Although a \"new project\" is mentioned, the emphasis on purchase-related activities makes \"Purchase\" the most appropriate. I am considering if the new project is intertwined with purchases, but the purchase requests seem central to this ticket's purpose. I need to make sure the project aspect doesn't negate the purchase focus.\n\n\n**Revisiting Project Influence**\n\nI'm now weighing the \"Internal Project\" component again, but the repeated emphasis on \"purchase requests\" is compelling me to prioritize \"Purchase.\" Although a new project is mentioned, the core seems to be processing requests and reporting. I'm focusing on the ticket's immediate function: managing purchases. I need to confirm whether the project truly drives this or is secondary.\n\nI'm starting to think \"Purchase\" makes the most sense. The multiple occurrences of \"purchase requests\" suggest the primary function of this ticket.\n\n\n**Confirming Primary Categorization**\n\nI'm now concluding that \"Purchase\" is the dominant category. The ticket explicitly mentions \"purchase requests,\" and the context seems to revolve around processing and reporting related to these requests. While the \"new project\" aspect is present, the immediate focus is on managing purchase-related activities. My analysis now leans strongly towards purchase requests as the core function of the ticket. I have reviewed all the options, and am confident.\n\n\n**Final Project Category Assessment**\n\nI'm now prioritizing \"Internal Project\" as the appropriate category. While \"purchase requests\" are mentioned, the ticket's core seems project-oriented, involving both purchasing and reporting. After reevaluating, it appears the ticket is about a project designed to manage and report on purchase requests. Given the project context and broader scope, \"Internal Project\" is the best fit. I've concluded this after carefully considering all options and the nature of the tasks described.\n\n\n**Refining Project Association**\n\nI'm now prioritizing the \"Internal Project\" category. Initially, I leaned toward \"Purchase\" because of the explicit \"purchase requests\" mention. However, upon deeper analysis of the broader context, including the \"new project\" and \"write client level reports\" components, it appears the ticket concerns a project encompassing purchase-related activities. This shift reflects a more holistic understanding of the ticket's core function.\n\n\n"
