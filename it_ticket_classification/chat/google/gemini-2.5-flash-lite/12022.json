I am leaning towards the \"Access\" category, as the issue pertains to accessing a system (Outlook) and its features (calendar) from a mobile device. I will proceed with this category unless further analysis reveals a more fitting classification.\n\n\n**Defining Access Method**\n\nOkay, after further review, the user clearly seeks a method to *access* their Outlook calendar. They're struggling to connect from their personal phone, and they've already checked the guides without success. The ticket centers on the \"Access\" aspect, meaning connecting to a system, not a broader function. All other categories feel less appropriate given the specific problem highlighted in this user's submission.\n\n\n**Refining Access Point**\n\nOkay, so I have identified the user's focus on calendar access within Outlook. They're trying to view their calendar, specifically, which suggests a narrowed scope. The core issue is connectivity; they are having trouble *connecting* to their Outlook calendar from their personal device, not a wider Outlook application issue. The \"Access\" category seems more appropriate now, especially due to this new context.\n\n\n"
