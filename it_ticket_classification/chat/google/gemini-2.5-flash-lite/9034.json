The phrase \"cannot approve requests\" seems central. I'm focusing on the implied workflow issue, attempting to map it to the provided categories.  I'm exploring the nuances of \"approve\" in this context, considering it may indicate a lack of administrative rights or access.\n\n\n**Revisiting Keywords**\n\nI'm refining my keyword analysis, re-evaluating phrases like \"cannot approve requests\" and \"user advised he approve requests.\" I'm also considering the implications of \"possible perform changes\" in relation to access levels. I'm leaning toward the \"Access\" category, understanding it encompasses broader permission issues, including potential administrative rights needs.\n\n\n**Narrowing the Focus**\n\nI'm now fully committed to the \"Access\" category, solidifying its suitability. The repetition of \"cannot approve requests\" makes this clear. I've ruled out \"Administrative rights\" due to its narrower scope. My primary focus is on the user's inability to perform a specific function, a clear access restriction.\n\n\n"
