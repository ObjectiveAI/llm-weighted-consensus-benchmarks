It seems like a new employee onboarding request, but I need more information to be sure. I'm leaning toward \"HR Support\" because of the \"new starter\" phrasing, but I'll keep other options open.\n\n\n**Defining the Core Issue**\n\nI've refined my understanding of the ticket's core issue. Analyzing the extended text, the keywords \"starter forms,\" \"employment contract,\" and \"interns\" solidify my initial impression. It's becoming clearer that the primary concern revolves around onboarding new employees or interns, leaning heavily towards an HR-related workflow. My assessment is that \"HR Support\" is indeed the most accurate category, based on the specific evidence.\n\n\n"
