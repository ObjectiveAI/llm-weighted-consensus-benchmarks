My initial assessment leans toward \"Access,\" given the core action involves granting cards for physical access. However, I'm now also considering if the context of \"graduates\" might imply an HR-related access, or perhaps an administrative procedure.\n\n\n**Analyzing the Context**\n\nMy assessment strongly indicates \"Access\" as the primary category. The repeated keywords, \"assigning access cards\" and \"graduates,\" solidify this conclusion. While \"HR Support\" has a slight relevance, the core action revolves around granting access credentials, making \"Access\" the most suitable choice. The absence of terms related to hardware repair, storage, purchasing, or project management further supports this. I've now crafted the JSON response: `{ \"category\": \"Access\" }`.\n\n\n**Finalizing the Categorization**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket text with fresh eyes, and the repeated emphasis on \"assigning access cards\" and \"graduates\" keeps reinforcing my \"Access\" conclusion. While the mention of graduates could have a slight HR angle, the primary function remains granting access credentials. The process is clearly access management. I've confirmed my initial JSON output, ensuring it adheres to the schema: `{ \"category\": \"Access\" }`.\n\n\n"
