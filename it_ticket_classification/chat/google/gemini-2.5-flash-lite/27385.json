My focus is on dissecting the description to identify keywords and context that point towards Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, or Administrative rights.\n\n**Assigning Ticket Category**\n\nI'm working on pinpointing the most accurate category for this IT ticket. My current analysis leans towards **Purchase**, given the strong emphasis on \"requisition rejected\" and related purchasing details, despite the initial mention of a monitor stand.\n\n**Updating Purchase Status**\n\nI've refined my assessment. The IT ticket details, particularly the repeated \"requisition rejected\" and associated purchasing metadata, strongly indicate the core issue pertains to the procurement process itself. Therefore, I'm classifying this under **Purchase**.\n\n"
