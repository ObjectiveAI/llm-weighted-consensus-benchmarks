The ticket description, with its mentions of \"leaver,\" \"leaving date,\" and \"ad forwarder,\" is pointing strongly toward an \"Access\" issue. I'm focusing on the keywords to refine the classification.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Scope**\n\nI've been analyzing the ticket description, recognizing the recurring theme of access management for a departing employee. The keywords like \"AD rights,\" \"personal mailbox,\" and \"token\" reinforce this. I'm leaning heavily towards \"Access\" as the primary category, while considering how the other options, like \"HR Support,\" might be secondary.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the ticket content, and the focus is solidifying around access management during an employee's departure. The keywords, including \"mobile phone subscription\" and \"inventory,\" support the \"Access\" category, as they're also related to the overall offboarding process and access deprovisioning.\n\n\n"
