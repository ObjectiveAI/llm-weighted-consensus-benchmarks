After a second review, \"Access\" seems most relevant given the mention of adding and granting access. I am now exploring possible subcategories to add further clarity.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down Options**\n\nI've refined my thinking by focusing on \"Access\" as the primary category for this ticket. The addition of \"owner\" strongly implies a need to grant permissions within a system. I am now evaluating the possibility of also including \"Internal Project\" as a secondary category, assuming that \"web\" refers to a project's digital presence.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Request**\n\nI'm now leaning heavily towards \"Access\" as the primary category, but I'm still considering \"Administrative rights\" as a secondary option. The \"add owner\" request points directly toward access control. The \"web\" element makes me wonder about internal projects, but that's less crucial.\n\n\n**Defining the Primary Focus**\n\nI'm now fully committed to \"Administrative rights\" as the primary category for this ticket. The key phrase \"add owner\" points directly to the granting of control and management capabilities within a web-based system. I considered \"Access\" but \"Administrative rights\" is more precise, encapsulating the high level of permission indicated by \"owner.\" I'm confident in this categorization now.\n\n\n**Defining the Primary Issue**\n\nI'm now fully committed to \"Administrative rights\" as the primary category for this ticket. The addition of an \"owner\" signifies a clear need for control and management within the web-based system.  While \"Access\" is broad, \"Administrative rights\" accurately reflects the level of privilege requested.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Issue**\n\nI'm now fully committed to \"Administrative rights\" as the primary category for this ticket.
