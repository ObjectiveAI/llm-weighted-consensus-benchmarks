I have considered other options but this seems the most relevant.\n\n\n**Confirming HR Alignment**\n\nI've determined that \"HR Support\" is the optimal category for this ticket, given the consistent themes of holiday booking, requests, and line manager involvement. My analysis points firmly toward this classification, having reviewed other options. This appears to be the most appropriate category, after careful consideration of all options.\n\n\n"
