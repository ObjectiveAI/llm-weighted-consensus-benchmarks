This points me squarely towards the \"Access\" category as the most fitting classification.\n\n**Selecting IT Ticket Category**\n\nI've thoroughly analyzed the provided text, identifying recurring themes of \"access,\" \"log in,\" \"roles,\" and specific system mentions like \"git.\" These keywords strongly suggest that the primary request concerns user permissions and entry to various resources, leading me to classify it under the \"Access\" category.\n\n"
