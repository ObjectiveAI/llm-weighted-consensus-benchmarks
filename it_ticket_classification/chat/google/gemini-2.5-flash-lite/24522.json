It seems to lean towards HR or administrative tasks, specifically around financial reimbursements and personnel changes, rather than core IT issues.\n\n**Identifying the Ticket Type**\n\nI've analyzed the text, and the recurring themes of \"per diem,\" \"accounts payable,\" and \"term assignment/relocation\" strongly indicate that the primary focus is on administrative and HR-related processes, not typical IT issues. Therefore, I'm assigning this to \"HR Support.\"\n\n"
