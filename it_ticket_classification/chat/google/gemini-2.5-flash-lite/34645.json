Phrases like \"error error\" and \"locked with status error\" point towards a technical problem. This leads me to believe the issue falls under either \"Hardware\" or \"Access\" categories. Analyzing further, \"deleting can correctly enter submit\" doesn't quite fit either, so I need to check the exact problem.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Problem**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and connecting the dots. \"Error error\" and the locked status definitely highlight an access issue, specifically a technical one. The user's actions, like trying to delete something, further strengthen the access problem and rule out hardware or storage concerns. Based on this, Access appears to be the most relevant category.\n\n\n**Clarifying the Focus**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on Access. The text points to a recurring error preventing a Senior Consultant from completing a simple deletion and submission. I've considered other categories, but the \"locked\" status and error messages overwhelmingly indicate an access problem. Deletion and submission actions suggest this is a core function denied. I've ruled out other categories, leaning heavily toward Access.\n\n\n"
