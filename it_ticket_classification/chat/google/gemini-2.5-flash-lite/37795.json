I'm trying to decide if this falls under general HR support, a process issue, or something else entirely.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Options**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and am leaning towards \"HR Support\". The recurring theme is submitting time cards for approval, and the rejection reasons point to specific HR-related processes. While there's a technical element in the system's error handling, the core issue is the time card submission itself. Access, Hardware, and Storage are clearly off the mark. I'm excluding Administrative Rights and Purchase as irrelevant to the problem. The \"Internal Project\" category doesn't fit the context either.\n\n\n**Categorizing Timecard Submissions**\n\nI've carefully considered the given text related to the IT ticket. I've focused on the recurring theme of timecard submission and approval, and rejected timecards. It seems that the described scenarios are related to HR processes and systems, making \"HR Support\" the most appropriate category. I've eliminated \"Hardware,\" \"Access,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights\" as these don't align with the core issue described in the text.\n\n\n"
