The phrases \"unable to upload document\" and \"cannot upload documents contract\" are key. Given the options, I'm leaning heavily towards \"Access,\" but I'm just quickly confirming no other options make more sense. The word \"contract\" hints at the potential for a business process related item as well, however I don't see any other suitable options.\n\n\n**Finalizing Category Selection**\n\nI've carefully considered the given ticket text and available categories. While \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights\" are potential fits, the core issue is the *inability to upload*, which directly points to \"Storage\". The keywords \"unable to upload document\" and \"cannot upload documents contract\" cement this conclusion. Although \"contract\" is mentioned, the issue isn't contract-specific, but an upload failure, so I feel I can discard the other options. \"Storage\" is the best fit, in my current opinion.\n\n\n**Evaluating Storage Solution**\n\nI've carefully assessed the ticket's wording and available categories. While \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights\" are potential fits, the core issue is the *inability to upload*, which points to \"Storage\". The text \"unable to upload document\", \"cannot upload documents contract\", and \"contract attachments\" strongly support this. The issue isn't contract-specific, but an upload failure, so I'm discarding alternative options. I believe that \"Storage\" is the best fit.\n\n\n"
