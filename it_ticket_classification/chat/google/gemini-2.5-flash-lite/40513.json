My focus is on identifying keywords related to data loading issues and performance bottlenecks to assign it to the most appropriate IT ticket category.\n\n**Determining Ticket Classification**\n\nI'm analyzing the ticket details to pinpoint the most suitable category. The problem appears to be a performance or UI issue within an application, specifically related to data loading and display, rather than hardware, access, or HR support directly.\n\n**Mapping Ticket Details**\n\nI'm continuing to analyze the provided ticket to determine the most fitting category. Given the mentions of \"promotion history\" and \"employee individual screens\" along with the loading issue, \"HR Support\" appears to be the most appropriate classification, as it addresses a functional problem within a system likely related to HR operations.\n\n**Classifying System Functionality**\n\nI've refined my categorization process, focusing on the system's functionality rather than just data loading. Given the specific mention of \"promotion history\" and \"employee individual screens,\" I now see that \"HR Support\" is the most fitting classification, as it directly addresses issues within an HR-related application.\n\n"
