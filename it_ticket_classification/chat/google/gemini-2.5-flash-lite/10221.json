Now I'm trying to decide the best category: \"HR Support\" or \"Access\", since employee access may be an issue.\n\n\n**Prioritizing HR and Access**\n\nI'm now leaning heavily towards a primary categorization of \"HR Support\" for this ticket. The preponderance of \"leaver\" keywords, coupled with the mention of processes like leaver forms, strongly suggests an HR-driven workflow. While access-related tasks are clearly involved (mailbox, AD rights, etc.), I believe they are secondary to the overall leaver process, and can be viewed as sub-tasks within the HR workflow. I'm feeling that \"Access\" as a standalone category is not quite correct.\n\n\n**Determining the Primary Category**\n\nI've examined the ticket text, and now I'm certain the most accurate primary category is **HR Support**. While various keywords point to access-related tasks (mailbox, AD rights, roaming profiles), the overarching theme revolves around an employee's departure. This leans towards an HR-driven process. The mention of \"leaver\" keywords strongly points to an HR context, encompassing these IT tasks as sub-steps within the larger employee offboarding procedure.\n\n\n"
