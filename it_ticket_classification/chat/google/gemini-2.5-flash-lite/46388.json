The initial focus on \"Access\" is reinforced by the \"unauthorized access\" error. However, the root cause might be administrative privileges. I'm carefully weighing whether the lack of access is a general issue or a specific permission problem, ensuring the correct categorization.\n\n\n**Categorizing Access Problem**\n\nI'm now fully immersed in the nuances of access rights.
