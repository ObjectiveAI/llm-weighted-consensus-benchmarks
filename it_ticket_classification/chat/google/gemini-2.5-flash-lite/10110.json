Phrases like \"pm discipline\" and \"starter pm\" are giving me pause, as they don't immediately align with typical IT categories. I'm carefully considering how terms like \"client\" and \"rights\" might relate to the provided options: \"Hardware\", \"HR Support\", \"Access\", \"Miscellaneous\", \"Storage\", \"Purchase\", \"Internal Project\", and \"Administrative rights.\" My goal is to pinpoint the most precise category.\n\n\n**Refining Category Selection**\n\nMy focus is narrowing in on the best category. Analyzing the keywords, the new employee onboarding angle, I'm leaning toward either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" The \"rights\" and \"codes\" strongly support these choices. The \"pm discipline\" concept seems peripheral to the core request which is establishing access for a new individual. I'm carefully weighing whether the level of access warrants the \"Administrative rights\" classification over the broader \"Access\" option.\n\n\n**Concluding Category Selection**\n\nMy thinking has led me to settle on \"Access\" as the most suitable category for the ticket. After reviewing the keywords \"rights,\" \"codes,\" and the new employee context, \"Access\" best encompasses the requested permissions setup, even if the \"pm discipline\" aspect is unclear. The ticket is likely for a \"starter\" to get general access.\n\n\n"
