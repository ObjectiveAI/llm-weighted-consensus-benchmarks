The keywords \"new starter\" and \"July\" have me leaning toward \"HR Support\" as a strong contender. I'm carefully considering all the options within the schema, including \"Access\" and \"Miscellaneous\", to ensure the most accurate classification. I will be sure to double-check my assumptions when the date and time values are more precise.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Best Fit**\n\nI've been analyzing the ticket description, focusing on the keywords. \"New starter\" is the key indicator, strongly suggesting either \"HR Support\" or \"Access\". While \"Hardware\" is possible, the ticket lacks any hardware-specific requests. Given the focus on onboarding, \"HR Support\" seems most relevant. I will also check if this fits the time the request has been submitted.\n\n\n**Determining the Primary Category**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket description and the provided categories. \"New starter\" is the central keyword. Analyzing each category, I'm leaning toward \"HR Support\". While \"Access\" is relevant, \"HR Support\" seems more encompassing for the initial onboarding process implied by \"new starter\". This choice best reflects the ticket's nature.\n\n\n"
