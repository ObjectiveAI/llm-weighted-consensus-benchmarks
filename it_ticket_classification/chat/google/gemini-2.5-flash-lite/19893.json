The text, \"new purchase po thursday march pm purchase po dear purchased received items galaxy,\" hints strongly at a \"Purchase\" related issue. I'll need to confirm this against the schema of possible categories: \"Hardware|HR Support|Access|Miscellaneous|Storage|Purchase|Internal Project|Administrative rights\". My next step is to further refine this preliminary categorization and consider other contextual clues, such as the mention of \"items galaxy\", to ensure complete accuracy.\n\n\n**Defining Purchase Scope**\n\nI've been analyzing the ticket text and mapping its keywords to the provided categories. The presence of terms like \"new purchase po,\" \"purchased,\" and \"device\" strongly suggests a \"Purchase\" related issue. I'm now refining the category by considering the lifecycle of a purchase from ordering, receiving, and potentially installing the device. The updated text suggests it may go beyond a simple purchase, as installation is mentioned.\n\n\n**Refining Category Determination**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the \"Purchase\" category for this ticket. The initial keywords led me there, and further examination solidifies the fit. Although \"Hardware\" seems relevant due to \"device\" mentions, the core of the issue revolves around the *process* of acquiring the device: purchase orders, receiving, and potential installation. The provided schema only has \"Purchase\", so I think that is the best fit. I'm confident that \"Purchase\" is the right classification.\n\n\n"
