After careful consideration of the provided text, I am leaning toward \"Administrative rights.\" The phrases about amending changes and changing approvers suggest this category.\n\n\n**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI'm now carefully examining the keywords within the ticket text to refine my choice. The phrases \"amend changes\" and \"changed resources\" point towards administrative actions. After reviewing the ticket, I'm leaning toward \"Administrative rights\" since the focus is on modifying system access and workflows, indicated by terms such as \"changed second approver.\" This seems like a strong fit.\n\n\n**Analyzing Access Control**\n\nI am now leaning heavily toward \"Administrative rights.\" The references to amending changes, the \"second approver,\" and affected resources all suggest direct modifications to access control and system permissions, not a new project. I am confirming my hypothesis that the ticket focuses on the reconfiguration of permissions, or user privileges.\n\n\n**Refining Categorization Decision**\n\nI've been re-evaluating the \"Internal Project\" possibility in light of the \"pm change system\" phrase, which could suggest a larger project. However, the consistent emphasis on \"approver\" and \"resources affected\" continues to steer me toward \"Administrative rights.\" Ultimately, even if initiated by a project manager, the core of the ticket's description still centers on modification of existing access controls and permissions, which aligns perfectly with this category.\n\n\n"
