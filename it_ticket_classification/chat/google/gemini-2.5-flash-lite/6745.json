My recent focus has been on keywords indicating an inability to access or being rejected from a resource, strongly suggesting \"Access\" as the primary classification.\n\n**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nI've completed the analysis of the provided text, focusing on keywords. The recurring themes of failed access, authentication issues, and rejection by the organization strongly point towards the \"Access\" category as the most fitting classification for this IT ticket.\n\n"
