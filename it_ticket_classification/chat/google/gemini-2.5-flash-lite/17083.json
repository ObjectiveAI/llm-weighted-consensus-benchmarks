My analysis now points to a stronger correlation with HR processes than initially thought. The recurring themes of employee departures, time reporting discrepancies, and required record updates all suggest an HR-related issue. The initial focus on \"missing time\" has expanded to encompass broader employee status and process adherence, solidifying the HR connection. I'm focusing on the employee data aspect of \"missing time.\"\n\n\n**Identifying the Root Cause**\n\nThe ticket analysis now centers around the underlying root cause. My thinking has shifted from a simple categorization to understanding the sequence of events. The employee departure (deletion) triggers a cascading need for time entry adjustments and process adherence. I'm focusing on the interplay between employee status changes, time reporting, and record updates, all of which fall under HR processes.\n\n\n"
