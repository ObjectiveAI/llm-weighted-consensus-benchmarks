My initial thought is leaning towards a potential \"Access\" issue, given the language used. I'm carefully considering whether this could also fall under \"Hardware\" due to the inability to connect, or perhaps \"Miscellaneous\" if it points to a broader network connectivity issue. I'm trying to determine the most relevant category.\n\n\n**Categorizing Access Issues**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on Access as the primary category, given the recurring theme of inaccessible resources and connection failures. While Hardware is a possibility, the wording emphasizes connection problems rather than hardware malfunction. I'm carefully considering the \"polls suspended\" issue and trying to determine if it's a symptom or the root cause, but the access issues seem more directly described.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Access Problems**\n\nI've been analyzing the ticket's recent details, shifting my focus to the core access problem. While initially considering Hardware, it now feels less relevant because the core of the issue involves connection failures. I am moving towards identifying the root of the problem and the specific access issues. I'm taking the poll issue as a symptom of a larger, underlying problem of reaching the \"frankfurt point\".\n\n\n"
