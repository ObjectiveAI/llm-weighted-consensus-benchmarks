The key seems to be identifying the main issue within the text. So far, \"new starter\" and \"joiner\" are the clearest indicators. Those are strong leads.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Category Determination**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the ticket content, and the focus is squarely on HR Support. While \"hardware\" pops up, it's clearly related to the onboarding of a new joiner. My analysis hinges on keywords like \"new starter,\" \"joiner,\" and \"starter form,\" which point directly to HR-related processes. I'm confident in classifying it this way, despite the hardware mention.\n\n\n**Assessing Category Relevance**\n\nI'm now carefully evaluating the initial categorization based on a deeper look at the ticket details. While there is mention of hardware and access, I've confirmed that the primary context is onboarding a new hire. The phrase \"starter form\" is very indicative of HR's involvement. Therefore, despite the presence of seemingly related keywords, the prevailing theme is HR-related onboarding processes.\n\n\n"
