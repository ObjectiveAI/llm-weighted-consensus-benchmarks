Currently, I'm leaning toward \"Miscellaneous\" due to the ambiguity of the request. The terms are broad and need further clarification, but no clear alternative is apparent. Further context is needed.\n\n\n**Categorizing the IT Request**\n\nI've re-evaluated the IT ticket and believe \"Internal Project\" best reflects its intent. The text focuses on establishing service tiers and dummy instances, aligning with internal development and testing activities. While \"Administrative rights\" might be involved, the core request revolves around setting up project-related configurations. The words clearly convey an internal task.\n\n\n**Identifying Project Intent**\n\nI've carefully re-examined the ticket's language, focusing on phrases like \"add new service tier\" and \"add dummy instance\". These terms now strongly suggest an internal project. While administrative rights could be relevant, the main goal is clearly to set up service tiers and testing instances, which is typical for project setup. This strongly supports \"Internal Project.\"\n\n\n"
