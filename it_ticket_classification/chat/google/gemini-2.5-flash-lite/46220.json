My primary goal is to accurately map the extracted core issue to the provided categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. I am currently considering different methods to achieve a precise mapping, prioritizing efficiency and accuracy.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've been analyzing the text to identify the root problem in each ticket. For the first one, the terms \"credentials\" and \"access\" strongly indicate an access-related issue, specifically concerning \"external contacts\" and a \"portal.\" The second ticket involves granting and navigating \"contribute access rights,\" also pointing towards access problems. I am now evaluating the best approach to generalize this categorization for any input.\n\n\n**Identifying Access Patterns**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the recurrent patterns within these tickets. \"Access\" is clearly the predominant category. The term \"credentials\" also points directly to access. Specifically, the third example is the most straightforward, focusing on \"access site.\" The previous summary mentioned the phrases \"add access site\" and \"create library.\" The analysis confirms that these are core concepts.\n\n\n**Determining Category Precision**\n\nI'm now refining the accuracy of my access-related categorization. The analysis of ticket content confirms \"Access\" is the appropriate primary category. I'm focusing on handling variations within \"Access,\" considering specific access types mentioned and how they relate to the broader category. I'm analyzing how terms like \"credentials,\" \"site,\" and \"folder\" relate to the different parts of the overall \"Access\" grouping.\n\n\n"
