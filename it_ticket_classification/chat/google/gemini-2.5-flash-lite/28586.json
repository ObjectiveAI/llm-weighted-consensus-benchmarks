The provided description seems to be related to employee onboarding, thus my analysis points to \"HR Support\" or \"Access\". However, I'm leaning toward 'Access' as the most fitting, since the email mentions 'starter form' and 'access'.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've been analyzing the ticket description, focusing on keywords and context. The phrase \"new starter\" and the presence of a \"starter form\" strongly suggest an onboarding scenario. While access might be a component, the fundamental issue appears to be initiating the new employee's onboarding process, making \"HR Support\" a strong contender. I'm weighing whether the subsequent access request is the primary issue here.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Ticket**\n\nI'm now prioritizing the \"HR Support\" category for this ticket, given the emphasis on \"new starter\" and the likely involvement of HR or recruiting. The \"starter form\" further supports this choice, as it is a key part of onboarding. The attached email suggests this request concerns the initial steps of bringing on a new employee. I'm satisfied that \"HR Support\" best reflects the intent.\n\n\n"
