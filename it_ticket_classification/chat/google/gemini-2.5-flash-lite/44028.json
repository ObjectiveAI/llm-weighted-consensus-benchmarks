After analyzing the text, my initial instinct is \"Access\" because the user's main concern revolves around an access card not functioning correctly. I'm exploring if there's any need to consider other categories. I need to make sure this is the most accurate classification.\n\n\n**Narrowing the Focus**\n\nI've decided to refine the category choice to specifically \"Access.\" The ticket's content and the user's issue point directly to problems with access control using the card. While hardware is involved, the primary concern is the functional \"access\" aspect of the card, not the card itself as a general piece of hardware. I feel confident with this categorization.\n\n\n**Revisiting the Categorization**\n\nI'm solidifying my previous conclusion; the most precise category for this ticket remains \"Access.\" While \"Hardware\" is a possibility, the issue is fundamentally about *using* the access card, not the card itself as a general piece of hardware. The user's goal is building access, and their problem is they can't access buildings due to a malfunctioning access card. The card's material state is secondary.\n\n\n"
