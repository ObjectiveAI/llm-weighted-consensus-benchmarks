After careful review, \"Access\" seems like the most appropriate choice given the provided text. I've ruled out the other options because they don't seem to apply, in my judgment.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Best Fit**\n\nI'm now focusing on solidifying \"Access\" as the correct category. The phrase \"access issues\" is central to the ticket's text, and the inability to \"load documents\" directly relates to access. I've eliminated \"Administrative rights\" for now because the ticket's focus is broader, concerning general access. I'm confident in \"Access\" given the context and my analysis.\n\n\n**Solidifying Category Choice**\n\nI'm feeling confident about selecting \"Access\". The recurring phrase \"access issues\" and the inability to \"load documents\" are strong indicators. While \"Administrative rights\" is related to access, the ticket's general nature makes the broader \"Access\" a better fit, unless the text specifically mentioned requiring elevated permissions. The other categories seem irrelevant based on the ticket description, so I'm satisfied with this classification.\n\n\n"
