I'm carefully analyzing the text to ensure the most appropriate categorization.\n\n\n**Analyzing Access Requests**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the text within the IT ticket, specifically focusing on phrases like \"add to the owners\" and \"re add owners.\" The goal is to pinpoint the most accurate category from the list. After careful consideration, I've narrowed it down to \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights.\" While \"Administrative rights\" is a possibility, I'm leaning towards \"Access\" as it encompasses the broader concept of permission and access control, which is the core request.\n\n\n"
