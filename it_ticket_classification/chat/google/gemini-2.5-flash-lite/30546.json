My focus is on identifying keywords to assign it to one of the provided categories. I've noted recurring mentions of \"polls change\" and \"pm\" as potential indicators.\n\n**Refining Category Assignment**\n\nI'm further analyzing the IT ticket. Keywords like \"polls change,\" \"deploy done,\" and \"links\" are leading me to consider \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" I'm leaning away from hardware or access-related categories given the context.\n\n**Classifying IT Ticket**\n\nI'm currently assessing keywords to categorize an IT ticket. Phrases like \"polls change,\" \"deploy done,\" and \"links\" suggest a potential fit within \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous\" categories, as other options like hardware or access seem less relevant.\n\n**Reviewing Category Fit**\n\nI'm re-evaluating the IT ticket's keywords. The combination of \"polls change,\" \"deploy done,\" and \"links\" strongly suggests a specific ongoing initiative rather than a general issue, making \"Internal Project\" a more fitting classification than \"Miscellaneous.\"\n\n**Assigning Ticket Category**\n\nI'm processing the IT ticket and am focusing on keyword analysis. The repetition of \"polls change,\" combined with \"deploy done\" and references to \"links\" and \"stories,\" strongly suggests it's related to an ongoing development or specific initiative rather than a general issue.\n\n**Assigning Ticket Category**\n\nI'm processing the IT ticket and am focusing on keyword analysis.
