So far, the text \"career wednesday december pm\" doesn't give me much to go on. There are no clear indicators of hardware issues, HR needs, access requests, or other common IT categories. I'm hesitant to assign a category without more information; I'm considering it might be miscellaneous.\n\n\n**Clarifying the Core Issue**\n\nI've been analyzing the provided text and it's definitely veering towards an HR-related system improvement. The \"careers\" references, the job posting locations, and the suggestions about candidate profiles and search capabilities solidify this. I'm leaning towards \"HR Support\" because the ticket appears to involve enhancements to a system used for recruitment and candidate management. I'm now certain of the HR focus, and considering the specific system and workflow changes.\n\n\n**Finalizing Category Selection**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's contents, and the \"HR Support\" category is the best fit. I've ruled out others like \"Hardware\" and \"Access\" due to lack of relevance, and dismissed \"Internal Project\" since the request is *for* HR improvements, even if those improvements might be part of an internal project. Ultimately, the focus on job postings, candidate profiles, and application functionality makes HR processes the clear center of this ticket's request.\n\n\n"
