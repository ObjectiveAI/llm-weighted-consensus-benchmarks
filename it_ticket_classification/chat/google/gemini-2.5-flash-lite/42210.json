The note about the error persisting across browsers but working in IE gives me pause. I'm now exploring whether the access problem stems from browser-specific behavior or underlying permissions.\n\n\n**Defining the Core Issue**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the root cause. While \"Access\" seems correct, the browser-specific behavior adds a layer of complexity. Analyzing the symptoms, the core problem is file access/opening. The \"Access\" category remains highly relevant due to these user access issues. My current thinking leans towards a network access or shared resource configuration, potentially tied to a browser incompatibility impacting file access. I am now considering what might be unique between the IE behavior and other browsers.\n\n\n"
