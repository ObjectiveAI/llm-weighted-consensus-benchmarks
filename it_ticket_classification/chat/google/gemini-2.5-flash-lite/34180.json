Based on the description, \"cannot access team members calendars called with issue she can access calendar any her members she,\" I'm leaning toward classifying it as an \"Access\" issue. There seems to be a clear problem with calendar permissions. I need to make sure this is the correct classification, but that's my current leading hypothesis.\n\n\n**Defining the Root Cause**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the specifics. The user's access issue seems rooted in calendar permissions. The error about identifying the owner strongly suggests that the core problem is related to authorization or incorrect configuration within the calendar system. I'm leaning toward an \"Access\" classification, but a deep dive into calendar system configurations may be necessary.\n\n\n**Clarifying Access Concerns**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's description, focusing on the user's inability to access team calendars. The error \"unable to identify calendar owner\" seals the deal; it's a definite access issue. While administrative rights might be tangentially involved, the primary problem is the user's access to existing calendar data. \"Access\" is the most precise categorization, encompassing the specific symptom.\n\n\n"
