The phrase \"provide the certificates\" strongly suggests an **Access** issue. \"Credentials\" further reinforces that line of thinking. I'm leaning heavily towards that category.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Ticket**\n\nThe initial analysis pointed towards \"Access,\" and further examination solidified that choice. The language of certificates, credentials, and granted requests all strongly suggest an issue around granting permission. I've ruled out other categories like Hardware, HR, and Storage, finding them irrelevant. The ticket's focus is clearly on enabling connection or usage.\n\n\n"
