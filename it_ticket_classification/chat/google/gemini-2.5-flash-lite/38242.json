Given the details about network performance issues like lag and audio drops, I'm concluding that \"Hardware\" is the most suitable classification within the available list.\n\n**Classifying Ticket Type**\n\nI'm refining the classification of the IT ticket. Based on the detailed symptoms of network performance degradation, including lag and audio issues, I'm leaning towards the \"Hardware\" category as the most encompassing choice from the provided enum, assuming it includes network infrastructure.\n\n**Classifying Network Problems**\n\nI've thoroughly analyzed the provided ticket description, focusing on the explicit mention of \"network issues\" coupled with specific symptoms like low speed, video lags, and audio drops. Considering the available categories, and the fact that network infrastructure components are indeed hardware, I've concluded that \"Hardware\" is the most appropriate and encompassing classification from the given enum list.\n\n"
