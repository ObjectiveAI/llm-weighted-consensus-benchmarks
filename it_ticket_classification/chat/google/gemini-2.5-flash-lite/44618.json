I'm exploring further to determine the primary category.\n\n\n**Defining Ticket Classification**\n\nI've been working on classifying an IT ticket. The text contains repeated references to \"annual leave request,\" \"approvals,\" and \"requestor.\" This strong textual evidence consistently points towards \"HR Support\" being the most fitting category. I've ruled out the other options because they're not relevant. The \"HR Support\" category perfectly aligns with the ticket's core content and intent.\n\n\n"
