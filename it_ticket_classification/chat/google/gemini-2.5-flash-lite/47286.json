I'm leaning toward \"access\" as the primary keyword, and I need to figure out the context around that, like what the user is trying to access and if there are error messages. I'm working to extract the most relevant terms from this request.\n\n\n**Determining the Best Fit**\n\nOkay, I've considered all the categories now. My analysis confirms \"Access\" as the most appropriate category, given the ticket's language about \"preventing accessing\" and the user's need for \"access contract documents.\" I've considered all the possible categories and eliminated each option that did not apply based on the user's description. The other options don't reflect the specific problem described.\n\n\n**Confirming Category Choice**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's content, focusing on the core problem: the inability to access documents. The critical phrases are \"preventing accessing\" and \"error occurred while loading.\" While storage is involved, the key issue is the user's lack of *access*. My process was systematic; I eliminated categories like hardware and HR support, which didn't apply. I ruled out \"Administrative rights\" because the issue isn't about permissions, but accessing existing files. \"Access\" is clearly the best fit.\n\n\n"
