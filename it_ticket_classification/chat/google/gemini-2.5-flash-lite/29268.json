The phrases \"video conf system,\" \"video conf,\" and \"video conf work\" are all clearly pointing towards a need related to hardware. This is the main focus right now.\n\n\n**Defining Primary Issue Type**\n\nI've refined my thinking by focusing on the core problem within the ticket text.  Terms like \"video conf system\" and \"video conf issues\" strongly indicate a hardware-related concern. While troubleshooting and user roles are mentioned, the central issue revolves around the malfunctioning video conferencing system. Therefore, I'm leaning towards \"Hardware\" as the most suitable category.\n\n\n"
