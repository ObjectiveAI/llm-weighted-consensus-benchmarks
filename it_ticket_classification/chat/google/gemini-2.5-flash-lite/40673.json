Keywords like \"oracle\" and \"access problem\" strongly suggest a need for access-related categorization. I'm carefully reviewing the text to determine the specific type of access issue and how to classify it appropriately within the provided categories. It's becoming increasingly clear this will fall under \"Access.\"\n\n\n**Defining the Solution**\n\nThe provided text has led me to identify the core issue as a recurring \"access problem\" with specific mentions of \"locked out\" pipelines. This, in turn, has allowed me to select \"Access\" from the available categories with confidence. It seems like the solution is becoming evident. I'm ready to move onto the next stage.\n\n\n"
