The text is a bit jumbled, but I'm leaning toward \"Access\" because of mentions of \"read rights\" and \"users.\" I'm also considering \"Internal\" as the request is from a user. The \"db\" component makes me hesitant about \"Storage\" initially, but it could be relevant. I will analyze the ticket text further to arrive at the most appropriate classification.\n\n\n**Finalizing Access Determination**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket's phrasing. Despite some extraneous terms, the core need remains \"read rights on db.\" The categories provided were re-evaluated, with \"Access\" emerging as the most fitting and accurate classification. While \"Storage\" was considered, the focus is on permission to use the db, not the storage of the data. The decision to categorize this under access is a direct reflection of the request for read permissions.\n\n\n"
