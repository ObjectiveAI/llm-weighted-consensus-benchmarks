The phrases \"defective monitor\" and \"external monitor stopped working\" strongly suggest a hardware issue. I'm leaning toward \"Hardware\" as the most suitable category. I'll confirm this by ensuring there aren't any other relevant categories, especially related to access or administration, but the focus seems to be on a physical device.\n\n\n**Narrowing the Options**\n\nI've honed in on the hardware component as the main concern, based on the ticket's language. I confirmed that \"Hardware\" remains the best fit, while I quickly dismissed the other options as they are not relevant to the problem. The phrase \"defective monitor\" makes \"Hardware\" a very easy choice.\n\n\n"
