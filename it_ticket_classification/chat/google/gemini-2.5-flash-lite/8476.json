Keywords are crucial; I'm focusing on \"flexible working\" to pinpoint the initial potential categories, and will keep searching for more clues to narrow down the possible options.\n\n\n**Narrowing Category Scope**\n\nI've honed in on the HR Support category. The text's focus on \"flexible working,\" employee retention, and cost benefits strongly aligns with HR policies. Although no immediate direct connections, employee accommodation could possibly relate to access. I'm now exploring the subtle distinctions between HR Support and related options, refining my understanding of the ticket's core request.\n\n\n**Defining the Primary Category**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's text, identifying \"flexible working\" as the central theme, emphasizing its impact on costs, productivity, and employee retention. This analysis solidifies \"HR Support\" as the most appropriate category, as these elements directly align with HR policies and functions. I am now confident that this category provides the most suitable fit.\n\n\n"
