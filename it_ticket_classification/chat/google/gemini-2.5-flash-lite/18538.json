Given the options, \"Internal Project\" seems the most fitting as network upgrades often fall under larger initiatives, though it's not a perfect fit.\n\n**Refining Network Ticket Category**\n\nI'm continuing to refine the categorization of the network upgrade ticket. My current assessment leans towards \"Internal Project\" as the most suitable fit, given the \"planned works\" aspect suggesting a scheduled IT initiative. However, I'm still considering \"Miscellaneous\" as a fallback if a more direct IT operations category were available.\n\n**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI'm currently analyzing the ticket description \"notification network upgrade planned works\" to assign it the most fitting category. After reviewing the provided options, \"Internal Project\" appears to be the most suitable designation for a planned network upgrade initiative.\n\n"
