My current focus is on determining the most accurate classification within the given schema constraints.\n\n**Prioritizing HR Over Hardware**\n\nI've reviewed the ticket text again and am leaning towards \"HR Support.\" While hardware is mentioned, the core driver for the cancellation seems to be the employee's departure, a distinctly HR-related event. I'm focusing on ensuring this primary driver dictates the categorization.\n\n**Focusing on Employee Departure**\n\nI'm now prioritizing the \"HR Support\" category. My recent analysis confirms that the core driver for the ticket's request is an employee's departure, making HR-related actions the most fitting classification for this IT ticket.\n\n**Classifying Ticket Content**\n\nI'm refining the categorization of the IT ticket. My latest focus is on identifying the primary driver for the request, weighing mentions of \"leaver\" against equipment-related phrases to determine if \"HR Support\" or \"Hardware\" is the most fitting category based on the provided schema.\n\n"
