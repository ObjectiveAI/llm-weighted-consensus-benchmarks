I've pinpointed key phrases like \"pipeline code,\" \"extended,\" and \"add forecast period,\" which suggest a development or enhancement request. I'm leaning toward classifying it as a feature request, although the lack of specific details makes definitive categorization tricky. Further analysis of the text might reveal more clues.\n\n\n**Defining the Ticket's Focus**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on \"Internal Project\" as the best fit. Analyzing \"pipeline code,\" \"extended,\" and \"add forecast period,\" I see strong evidence of software development. The ticket's focus is on modifying code for operational needs or new functionality. Considering this, \"Internal Project\" aligns perfectly with the nature of the request.\n\n\n**Choosing the Right Label**\n\nI've honed in on the strongest signals in the text. \"Pipeline code\" and \"add forecast period\" are key. The former points to software development; the latter, to functionality updates. With that in mind, I determined \"Internal Project\" is the best label, as this update clearly signals internal software work.\n\n\n"
