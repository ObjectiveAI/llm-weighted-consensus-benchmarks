I've narrowed down the options, considering the keywords \"problem with word\" and \"can documents only mode.\"  My current thinking leans towards \"Access\" or potentially \"Miscellaneous\" depending on the broader context of the issue. I'm carefully evaluating if this is an access restriction or a general software glitch.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Root Cause**\n\nI've been drilling down on this IT ticket. The user can't type in Word, stuck in a \"documents only\" mode. I'm leaning toward \"Access\" because it feels like a permissions glitch preventing full software use. My analysis excludes \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and others, leaving me torn between \"Access\" and maybe \"Administrative rights,\" but \"Access\" is looking increasingly likely. It seems like the core issue revolves around the user's ability to edit, suggesting some kind of access restriction.\n\n\n**Defining the Category**\n\nI'm now confident that \"Access\" is the best fit. The inability to type in Word, specifically described as \"documents only mode,\" clearly points to a restriction on accessing full editing features. I've re-evaluated \"Administrative rights,\" but the core issue isn't about gaining admin privileges, but rather the user's ability to modify documents, which aligns perfectly with an access-related problem. The other categories are irrelevant, leaving \"Access\" as the clear and accurate choice.\n\n\n"
