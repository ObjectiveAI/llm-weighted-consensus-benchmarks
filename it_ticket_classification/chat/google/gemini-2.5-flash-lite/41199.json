It seems the user needs help with something related to an expense report, indicating a possible HR or administrative issue. I'm carefully comparing the keywords to the available categories to make the best match, and I'm leaning toward HR Support or Administrative Rights.\n\n\n**Narrowing Category Choices**\n\nI'm now carefully evaluating the categories based on the ticket's text. I've ruled out \"Hardware,\" \"Access,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative Rights\" as they don't seem like the best fit for this particular issue. \"Miscellaneous\" remains a possibility, but I'm leaning heavily towards \"HR Support.\" The issue explicitly involves an \"expense report\" needing \"approval\" because the designated approver is \"no longer working,\" directly implicating a personnel change within a process typically handled by HR or Finance. \n\n\n"
