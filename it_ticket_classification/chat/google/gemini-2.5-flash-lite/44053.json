The user's report of search issues, especially when others receive correct results and after they've performed basic troubleshooting, strongly suggests a permissions or configuration problem.\n\n**Processing Ticket Data**\n\nI'm actively processing the IT ticket description, aiming to precisely assign it to its correct category. My current focus is on dissecting the user's reported issues and cross-referencing them with the available categories to identify the most fitting match.\n\n**Analyzing Search Issues**\n\nI'm currently examining the ticket description, focusing on the reported \"search issue\" related to computers. My analysis indicates a strong correlation with access-related problems, given that other users are obtaining correct results and the user has already performed basic troubleshooting.\n\n"
