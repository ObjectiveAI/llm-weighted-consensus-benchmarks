The initial text mentions a \"new starter\" and a \"starter form,\" leading me to lean towards \"HR Support.\" However, the lack of specifics necessitates further scrutiny of the potential subcategories within \"HR Support.\" I'll need to determine if this requires user access, hardware, or internal project. The text is minimal, so I will have to rely on keywords.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Options**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the ticket text and the available categories. The core issue seems to center around a \"starter form\" for a \"new starter\". While access is relevant, the initial form hints at an HR-related process. My focus is now on the nuances between \"HR Support\" and other potentially relevant categories. I'm leaning toward \"HR Support\" but need to confirm its suitability.\n\n\n**Revisiting Ticket Context**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket text with fresh eyes, isolating \"new starter\" and \"starter form\" as the key phrases. The \"starter form\" is pivotal. While access is a possibility, the form itself is the primary focus. I'm now certain that the ticket's core relates to HR processes, which IT often handles, such as initial form processing or onboarding. This solidified my selection of the \"HR Support\" category.\n\n\n"
