Given the details concerning timecard approval flows and routing slip errors, I'm weighing \"HR Support\" against potential system or administrative issues that might indirectly impact HR functions.\n\n**Categorizing IT Issues**\n\nI'm processing the details of a new IT ticket. My current focus is on accurately assigning it to the correct category, considering that the core of the issue appears to be a \"timecard approval flow error\" stemming from a \"routing slip\" malfunction, directly impacting an HR-related process.\n\n"
