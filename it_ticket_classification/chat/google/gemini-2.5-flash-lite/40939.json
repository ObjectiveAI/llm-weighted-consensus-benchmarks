                    "reasoning": "**Defining Ticket Categories**\n\nI'm currently working to define the appropriate category for the IT ticket. Considering the description \"not showing as submitted sent friday showing submitted hi\", my initial assessment points towards a potential **Access** or **Miscellaneous** issue. I need to clarify the specifics further to ensure accurate categorization, as the information is quite limited.\n\n\n**Analyzing Submission Issues**\n\nI've been analyzing the ticket description more closely. The core of the issue seems centered around discrepancies in how the submission status is being displayed. Phrases like \"not showing as submitted\" and \"showing submitted\" are pivotal. They're asking why a submitted report isn't reflecting correctly. They have a button to submit. Based on the analysis, I'm leaning toward either **Access** (if the problem is interpreted to be about displaying correct access) or **Miscellaneous** (as the display issue doesn't perfectly fit other categories), but am leaning towards the latter.\n\n\n**Revising Category Assignment**\n\nI've been re-evaluating the initial category assignment. While **Miscellaneous** still seems like a good fit, the emphasis on a discrepancy between \"not showing as submitted\" and \"showing submitted\" has me reconsidering. The user is questioning the *display* of the submission status and why it doesn't match their expectations. They seem to have the button, but something is displaying incorrectly. Perhaps the user doesn't have the permissions to see the correctly submitted report. This implies they are seeing the submitted status correctly, but some other access related task is not happening. Given this closer analysis, I'm leaning more towards **Access** because the core issue may be the user's *perceived* inability to *view* the expected status or data associated with the submission. The problem might be a display discrepancy due to access or reporting permissions.\n\n\n**Categorizing Submission Display**\n\nI'm now focusing on the ticket's core issue: a discrepancy between the expected and displayed submission status, coupled with a general system reporting issue. It seems the user can submit, but there's a problem with what's shown after submission. This issue is not clear within the other categories available, and I'm leaning toward **Miscellaneous** as this appears to be a broader system malfunction. However, I am still analyzing if an access problem is implied.\n\n\n**Determining Ticket Origin**\n\nI'm now carefully examining the ticket's underlying nature to select the best category. The user's description, specifically the discrepancy between the submitted status shown and their perception (and the attached screenshot of the button) requires further analysis. I am trying to determine the *why* of the status, not the permissions, which is pushing me toward **Miscellaneous**. However, a lack of appropriate permissions or a display problem might be involved, which points to **Access**.\n\n\n**Refining Category Selection**\n\nI'm now carefully revisiting the initial assessment. The focus is on the discrepancy in submission status: the user sees it as submitted, but also implies it's *not*. The screen capture of a submit button further complicates things. I'm leaning toward **Miscellaneous** as the overarching issue is a reporting anomaly or a system functional error. However, a slight doubt persists about whether there's an underlying access-related component to this display error.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Category Assignment**\n\nI'm now fully immersed in the ticket's core issue of an inconsistent submission status report: the user can submit, and the report is marked as submitted, but there is still a submit button visible. This strongly points to a system anomaly. The user is asking \"why\" this is the status, so that indicates a *Miscellaneous* category.\n\n\n**Categorizing System Discrepancy**\n\nHaving re-evaluated the user's report of a conflicting submission status \u2013 showing as submitted despite the submit button's presence \u2013 the core issue appears to be a systemic reporting anomaly. They are asking why this is happening, and this appears to be a functional error. While an underlying access or permission problem *could* be involved, the issue focuses on display, and thus I've categorized it as **Miscellaneous**.\n\n\n**Evaluating the System Anomaly**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the system's incorrect reporting of the submission status, where the submit button persists despite the \"submitted\" indication. My assessment leans firmly toward **Miscellaneous**, recognizing this as a display and system anomaly. They are asking why. This likely points towards a bug and needs further investigation.\n\n\n\n"
