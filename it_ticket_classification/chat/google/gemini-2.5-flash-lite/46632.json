I'm exploring if a functional or process-oriented category would be more precise.\n\n**Focusing on Access Issues**\n\nI'm currently investigating the best categorization for an IT ticket concerning an \"oracle approval issue.\" My focus is honing in on \"Access\" as the primary classification, given the details around ownership transfer and the ongoing process of sheet approvals, which I believe strongly points to a permissions-related or workflow access problem within Oracle.\n\n**Investigating Oracle Approval Flow**\n\nI'm currently refining my thoughts on categorizing this \"oracle approval issue.\" While the ownership transfer initially suggested \"Access,\" the ongoing \"sheet approval being sent still\" implies a potential workflow or configuration problem within the approval process itself, rather than a simple lack of entry. I'm weighing if this points to a functional or process-oriented classification over a broad \"Access\" tag.\n\n**Investigating Approval Workflow**\n\nI'm currently focusing on the nature of this \"oracle approval issue.\" While ownership transfer was mentioned, the persistent \"sheet approval being sent\" suggests the core problem lies within the workflow's configuration or the system's authorization logic, rather than a simple lack of user access. I'm exploring categories that better reflect this functional or process-related breakdown.\n\n"
