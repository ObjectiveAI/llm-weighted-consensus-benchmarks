I'm leaning toward \"Internal Project,\" but I need to ensure it's not some other IT function, as the request is vague, which is throwing me off slightly. The attachment could provide a crucial clue; I should probably keep my options open.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Request**\n\nI've honed in on the ticket's core function: \"create a new project code.\" My analysis focuses on the phrase and its context. The user seeks help building the code. \"Internal Project\" now seems like the most fitting category, which should cover project setup, especially since the user needs to create said code. I'm waiting for the attached document.\n\n\n**Confirming Project Scope**\n\nI'm now fully focused on the ticket's central task: generating a new project code. The user needs help creating this code, based on the attached document. From my analysis, the request clearly falls under \"Internal Project\" as it involves initial setup. The phrase \"pas\" is likely part of the project name itself, which further solidifies my classification.\n\n\n"
