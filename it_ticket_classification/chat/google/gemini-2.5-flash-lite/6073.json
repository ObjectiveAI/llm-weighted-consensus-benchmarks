My approach is to identify relevant keywords within the text to map it to one of the categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, or Administrative rights. Based on the provided text, there are a few clues that may map to some of these options.\n\n\n**Refining Categorization Strategy**\n\nMy focus has shifted to the more definitive \"Storage\" category. The term \"exact storage report\" in the ticket is a clear indicator. I need to balance this specific keyword with the context of other terms, like \"reports\" and \"add column\", to fully understand the user's intent within the \"Storage\" context. The initial analysis revealed some overlaps, and I'm now refining the decision criteria to ensure accuracy.\n\n\n**Determining Primary Category**\n\nI've homed in on \"Storage\" as the primary category for this ticket. The presence of \"exact storage report\" is a definitive indicator.  I've considered other keywords like \"reports\" and \"add column,\" but the specificity of \"storage\" outweighs their influence.  My analysis now confirms this categorization.\n\n\n"
