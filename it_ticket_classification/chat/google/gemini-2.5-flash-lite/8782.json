The text \"leaver leaver form leave date location hello leaver form has filled by name leaving\" definitely points towards an HR-related issue. There is no mention of hardware, access, storage, purchases, internal projects, or administrative rights. Therefore, I believe the best category will be \"HR Support\".\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Keywords**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the text for further key indicators. Terms like \"AD forwarder,\" \"leaver mailbox,\" and \"roaming profile\" point strongly towards an IT-related offboarding process.  However, the predominant focus remains on the employee's departure. I'm leaning toward combining \"HR Support\" with a specific IT offboarding subcategory, if possible, but that might be getting too specific for this level.\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nI've been drilling down on the categories, and HR Support still stands out as the most accurate initial fit. While IT offboarding plays a significant role, the core issue stems from an employee's departure. I'm exploring the possibility of including a related sub-category alongside \"HR Support\", specifically linked to IT offboarding, to provide an even more refined classification. The keywords, though IT-centric, only apply due to an HR-initiated event.\n\n\n**Defining the Core Focus**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the best overarching concept, and I've concluded that \"HR Support\" remains the most accurate fit.  While IT elements are present, they are secondary. This ticket is primarily driven by the HR-initiated employee departure. The focus is on the *process* of offboarding rather than the specific technical tasks.  \n\n\n**Prioritizing the Core Issue**\n\nI'm now focusing on the single, most relevant category. After further reflection, I've confirmed that \"HR Support\" accurately reflects the primary nature of this request. The employee's departure is the fundamental driver, and all the IT tasks are downstream consequences. This clarifies that \"HR Support\" encompasses the essential context for this ticket.\n\n\n"
