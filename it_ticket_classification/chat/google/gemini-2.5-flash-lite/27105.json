My primary task is to identify the most fitting label given the phrase \"addresses for devices\".\n\n\n**Mapping Ticket Content**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and its key phrases, such as \"devices\", \"addresses\", and network-related terms. Given the focus on device addresses and network infrastructure modifications, the most fitting category seems to be \"Hardware,\" as it encompasses device-related issues. I've ruled out HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights, as they don't capture the essence of the text.\n\n\n**Identifying Hardware Focus**\n\nI've carefully reviewed the ticket text's mentions of \"devices,\" \"terminals,\" \"switches,\" and \"infrastructure,\" and I can see a clear hardware-centric theme. I also noted \"addresses,\" which reinforced the idea of device-related requests. The phrases \"terminal,\" \"switch,\" and \"phone\" further point to physical equipment.  I am certain \"Hardware\" accurately captures the ticket's primary focus.\n\n\n"
