                    "reasoning": "**Refining Ticket Categorization**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the best category for this ticket. The 'review before submit' issue strongly suggests a problem with an internal application or system. Initially, I leaned toward \"Miscellaneous,\" but I'm now leaning more towards \"Internal Project,\" given the focus on a specific feature within a larger system. I'll need to confirm this assumption.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Culprit**\n\nI've been re-evaluating the best fit. While \"Internal Project\" felt promising, I'm now leaning away from it. The user's description points to a tangible usability flaw: an unreadable display. This leans more towards a software or UI problem. I'm hesitant about \"Miscellaneous\" as I feel we can be more specific, so I am going to try again.\n\n\n**Analyzing Feature Usability**\n\nI am now focusing on determining whether \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project\" is a better fit. While the described problem is functionally an issue, I'm finding it difficult to fit it perfectly within the given categories. The \"review before submit\" feature seems like an internal process, so perhaps \"Internal Project\" is the best fit, but I'll need to confirm that. It could also fall under \"Miscellaneous\" if it's a generally accessible feature.\n\n\n**Determining the Best Fit**\n\nMy current assessment is leaning toward \"Miscellaneous,\" though I continue to explore the nuances. While \"Internal Project\" felt initially plausible, the generalized nature of the feature (\"review before submit\") and the core problem\u2014unreadable rendering\u2014make \"Miscellaneous\" more fitting. The wording \"render unreadable\" doesn't suggest a project-specific issue, and more a usability one. I'm focusing on finding the closest match in the absence of a \"Software Bug\" category, and I feel confident about my choice.\n\n\n**Reflecting on the Context**\n\nMy thinking has moved towards the \"Internal Project\" category, considering the typical context of IT tickets. The focus on a \"review before submit\" process within a system strongly suggests an internal tool or application. The usability issue, while specific, points to a potential bug or flaw within that project's workflow. While \"Miscellaneous\" remains a viable option, \"Internal Project\" captures the likely nature of the system the ticket refers to. I feel confident about this, unless it has a separate category for software bugs.\n\n\n**Evaluating the Contextual Fit**\n\nAfter considering various possibilities, I'm leaning heavily towards \"Internal Project.\" This choice stems from the typical nature of IT tickets, where rendering issues within internal workflows are common. The \"review before submit\" feature strongly suggests a system or application built and maintained internally. While \"Miscellaneous\" remains an option, \"Internal Project\" best captures the context and likely root of this problem. I have a clearer picture now.\n\n\n**Evaluating Contextual Clues**\n\nI'm now focusing on inferring the likely system type. While the text doesn't explicitly mention \"internal,\" the nature of the \"review before submit\" feature leans towards an in-house tool. The IT context suggests this is a reasonable assumption. While I'm still weighing it, I'm finding \"Internal Project\" to be the most fitting label, as such tickets frequently refer to internally developed software with rendering issues.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Contextual Fit**\n\nI'm now focusing on the nuance. While initially considering \"Miscellaneous,\" the IT context strongly suggests that the \"review before submit\" feature likely belongs to an internal system. The rendering issue points to a specific internal project, and so I am leaning toward \"Internal Project\" as the better fit, prioritizing contextual probability.\n\n\n**Analyzing Possible Scenarios**\n\nI'm now focusing on inferring the nature of the application. The wording suggests a common feature rather than a niche problem. While \"Internal Project\" implies a specific project, the ticket could also describe a general application used internally. I am leaning toward \"Internal Project\" as the default assuming internal systems are the focus of these tickets.\n\n\n**Focusing on Internal Tools**\n\nI'm now focusing on inferring the likely system. The \"review before submit\" wording strongly suggests a common function found in internal applications. While it could be in an external system, most IT tickets relate to internal systems. I'm leaning toward \"Internal Project\" as the better descriptor.\n\n\n**Evaluating Contextual Inference**\n\nI'm now prioritizing the inferred nature of the application. Given the internal context, my focus narrows toward the \"Internal Project\" category, as the described feature (\"review before submit\") strongly implies a system built or maintained by the IT team. Though \"Miscellaneous\" is a safe option, the \"Internal Project\" category more precisely reflects the context of IT support tickets.\n\n\n"
