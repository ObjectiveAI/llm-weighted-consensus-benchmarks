I'm evaluating whether the issue is broader than a single user's network access.  Is it a widespread outage, or a localized problem?  This will help determine the best fit from the categories.\n\n\n**Revisiting the Category**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket description, focusing on the core issue: \"issues accessing net thursday pm.\" My prior assessment still leans toward \"Access\" as the primary category. The accompanying text appears to be a standard disclaimer, irrelevant to the core IT problem. No other category, such as Hardware or Storage, seems appropriate based on the limited information. I remain confident that \"Access\" is the most fitting choice.\n\n\n"
