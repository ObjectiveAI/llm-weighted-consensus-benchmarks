It appears to be related to timecards, which likely falls under HR Support or Access. I'm leaning toward HR Support given the specifics. Now, I will reevaluate my current classification.\n\n\n**Revisiting Category Assignment**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket text, and timecard issues persist. The initial categorization under HR Support seems correct, as these problems involve employee time tracking, a core HR function. I'm confident in sticking with HR Support as the most appropriate category for these tickets.\n\n\n"
