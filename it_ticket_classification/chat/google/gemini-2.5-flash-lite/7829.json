After examining the text regarding moving contracts, I believe the core issue is contract management. My initial inclination is towards \"Storage\" as the primary bucket. This is because the context of \"move\" seems closely tied to file storage. However, I am still considering other categories to ensure the optimal match.\n\n\n**Revising Category Choice**\n\nAfter reviewing the ticket text, I've decided that \"Storage\" is the most accurate category. While \"Miscellaneous\" was initially considered, the emphasis on moving contracts strongly suggests a storage operation. The contracts are likely digital files and, as such, fall under storage management when being moved. This choice allows for the most relevant assignment to the appropriate team and resources.\n\n\n"
