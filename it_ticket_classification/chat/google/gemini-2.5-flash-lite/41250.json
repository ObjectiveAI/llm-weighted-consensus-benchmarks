After careful analysis of the provided text, which includes references to \"conf room belgrade not operational\" and \"conf room belgrade operational,\" I'm leaning toward selecting the most suitable category. I'm carefully weighing the options to ensure the chosen category accurately reflects the nature of the issue.\n\n\n**Narrowing the Options**\n\nI've refined my thinking by carefully evaluating the text within the IT ticket. I've eliminated several categories, such as HR Support, Access, and Administrative Rights, as irrelevant. The phrases \"conf room belgrade not operational\" and \"great wall meeting room operational please fix\" have reinforced my conviction that the core of the issue lies within the domain of hardware, specifically conference room equipment. Thus, I'm confidently zeroing in on \"Hardware\" as the appropriate category.\n\n\n"
