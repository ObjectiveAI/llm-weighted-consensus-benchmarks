I need to determine if this falls under HR, Access, or another category, given the allowed options. I'm leaning toward HR Support, but further analysis may be needed.\n\n\n**Identifying the Category**\n\nI've carefully analyzed the ticket text, considering the available categories. The phrases point to issues with employee time tracking and reporting, particularly with \"direct reports.\" The options were narrowed down, with \"HR Support\" seeming to fit perfectly. It covers processes related to employee data, time submission, and managerial responsibilities. Ultimately, I've concluded that \"HR Support\" is the most appropriate category for this ticket.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Problem**\n\nI'm now certain that the ticket falls under \"HR Support.\" The issue is clearly centered on direct reports failing to submit time, which ties into employee data and managerial oversight, aligning perfectly with HR Support's scope. I've ruled out all other categories based on the ticket's specific wording and related processes.\n\n\n"
