It seems clear-cut, but I'll consider any nuances before making a final decision.\n\n\n**Reviewing the Evidence**\n\nI'm now fully immersed in the ticket text. The repeated \"purchase request\" and the explicit mentions of approved items solidify my original assessment. While I'm looking for a smoking gun to change my mind, the focus leans heavily toward \"Purchase.\" I'm also noticing the mention of specific items like ink, which further reinforces my judgment.\n\n\n"
