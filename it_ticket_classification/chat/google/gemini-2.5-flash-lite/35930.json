It's about a timecard issue, which doesn't fit neatly into any of the available options. It's leaning towards something like \"HR Support\" or maybe \"Miscellaneous,\" but I need to make sure before I finalize it.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Best Fit**\n\nI'm focusing now on the best category for this ticket. The key phrase is \"unable to submit timecard,\" and while access might play a role, the core issue is the submission itself. \"HR Support\" seems like the most logical choice as it directly deals with timecard functionality. I am excluding \"Hardware\", \"Storage\", \"Purchase\" and \"Internal Project\" since they are all clearly irrelevant. \"Miscellaneous\" is always an option, but I want to ensure the ticket goes where it can get the right level of support.\n\n\n**Pinpointing HR Alignment**\n\nI'm now fully convinced that \"HR Support\" is the optimal category for this ticket. The phrases \"unable to submit timecard\" and \"timecard\" are critical indicators.  The user's problem is centered on submitting the timecard, which is an HR-related system function, even if access is a contributing factor. The other options like \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Access\" don't capture the essence as accurately as HR support.\n\n\n"
