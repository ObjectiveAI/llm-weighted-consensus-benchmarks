Given the phrase \"notification system,\" I'm leaning toward \"Hardware,\" but I need to ensure it's the best fit compared to the other options. The description's brevity adds a level of complexity. I am evaluating whether the issue is broader than a simple hardware failure. I'll need to keep the context in mind to make the correct selection.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Options**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the ticket description, identifying key phrases such as \"touch screen terminal faulty\" and \"ordered replacement.\" The mention of software installation, including graphics and driver files, initially blurred the lines, but the central focus remains hardware-related. I am strongly leaning towards \"Hardware,\" given the tangible nature of the issue and the need for a physical replacement. I need to ensure this is indeed the most accurate category, before submitting it.\n\n\n**Refining Category Determination**\n\nI'm now fully confident that \"Hardware\" is the correct category for this IT ticket. After carefully reviewing the ticket description again, I can confirm that the core issue revolves around a faulty touch screen terminal, a tangible piece of hardware requiring replacement and associated software installation. While software installation is mentioned, it's secondary to the hardware failure. The description explicitly mentions ordering a replacement part, solidifying this categorization.\n\n\n"
