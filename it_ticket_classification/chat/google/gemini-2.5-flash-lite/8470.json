I'm leaning towards \"Access\" now, considering the repeated phrase \"communication specialists.\"  It seems like the request centers around granting access or permissions to these specialists. However, I am still evaluating \"Administrative rights\" in case there's an aspect of access management involved.\n\n\n**Finalizing Access Determination**\n\nI've decided to finalize the category as \"Access.\" The repeated phrase \"communication specialists\" strongly points to an access-related request, possibly for system permissions or platform access. While \"Administrative rights\" was considered, the focus is on enabling their work, which \"Access\" covers more generally. My reasoning now leans towards a definitive assignment.\n\n\n**Clarifying the Core Issue**\n\nI'm now solidly focused on the categorization. The text \"add communication specialists\" screams \"Access.\" It's likely they need permissions or accounts to do their communication-related work. While \"Administrative rights\" is relevant, it's a subset of the broader concept of \"Access,\" which feels more appropriate. The other categories are simply not relevant. I am now confident this is a request related to access.\n\n\n"
