The mention of \"reports not accessible\" and the need to \"extract data\" is leading me towards either \"Access\" or potentially \"Storage.\" The initial ambiguity is challenging, but I'm leaning towards \"Access\" as the primary concern appears to be data availability, rather than a storage capacity problem. I need to make sure the information can be organized to choose the best category.\n\n\n**Defining the Root Cause**\n\nThe ticket's problem has been further clarified as an access issue. While storage remains a slight possibility, the inability to get \"reports\" means access is more appropriate. Considering \"extract data\", I am deciding if \"extract\" means viewing or downloading. If it's about viewing, access fits perfectly. If downloading, it could be a storage concern. But the central issue still revolves around data access, therefore, I will continue to focus on this.\n\n\n"
