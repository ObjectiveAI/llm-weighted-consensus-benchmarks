                    "reasoning": "**Determining Ticket Type**\n\nI'm currently trying to determine the appropriate category for this IT ticket. After analyzing the provided text (\"new starter open states\"), I'm leaning toward the \"Access\" or \"HR Support\" category.  The \"new starter\" phrase heavily suggests an onboarding process and suggests an access-related task, so I will have to decide between those. I need to make sure I am not missing anything else.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down Categories**\n\n\\n\\nI'm still focused on categorizing this IT ticket. After reviewing the keywords, I'm now honing in on \"HR Support\" and \"Access\" as the most likely fits. The recurring theme of \"new starter\" and \"starter form complete\" strongly suggests onboarding, which aligns with HR support. However, the mention of \"credentials\" is pulling me towards \"Access\" since access provisioning is critical for new employees. I need to weigh these options carefully and look for any clues I might have overlooked. I still need to decide between those two, and make sure I am not missing any alternative.\n\n**Focusing On Onboarding**\n\n\\n\\nI'm now zeroing in on \"HR Support\" as the best fit for this IT ticket. The \"new starter\" theme is the dominant factor, encompassing form completion and the joining process. Although \"credentials\" indicate access, it's a part of the broader onboarding initiated by HR. While \"Access\" is relevant, the core issue stems from the HR-driven onboarding, making \"HR Support\" the more encompassing category. I am still excluding \"Access\", \"Administrative rights\" and \"Miscellaneous\".\n\n\n**Refining Category Selection**\n\n\\n\\nI'm now confident that \"HR Support\" is the most accurate categorization for this IT ticket. After a comprehensive review of the text, the recurring theme of \"new starter\" and \"starter form complete\" strongly indicates an onboarding process which is an HR responsibility. While \"credentials\" suggest access provisioning, that aspect is a sub-element of the broader onboarding process. The context of form completion and the mention of \"joining\" further reinforce the dominance of HR's involvement. Therefore,  \"HR Support\" effectively captures the core issue and its comprehensive nature, which makes it a better selection than Access.\n\n\n"
