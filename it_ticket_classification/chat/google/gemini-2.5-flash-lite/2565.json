Keywords like \"password reset\" and \"access\" are jumping out. \"Investigate\" suggests some troubleshooting might be needed. I'm weighing these clues against the available categories, considering the user's expertise in IT. My initial leaning is towards \"Access,\" but I'm holding off until I've thoroughly considered all options.\n\n\n**Defining Ticket Category**\n\nI've homed in on \"Access\" as the fitting category. \"Password reset\" was the smoking gun, and the other phrases were mostly noise. Based on the keywords, there's no ambiguity here. \"Investigate\" might point to troubleshooting, but the core issue, as implied, is account access. I'm ready to mark this ticket as \"Access\".\n\n\n"
