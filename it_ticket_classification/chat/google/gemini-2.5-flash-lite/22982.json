I'm cross-referencing this with the other phrases to be absolutely sure.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Category**\n\nI've honed in on the HR Support category. The phrases \"annual leave request,\" \"vacation requests,\" and others strongly align with leave management, which is an HR responsibility. I am now confident this is the proper classification, given the evidence within the ticket's text.\n\n\n"
