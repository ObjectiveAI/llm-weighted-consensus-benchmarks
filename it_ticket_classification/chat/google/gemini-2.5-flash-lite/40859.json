The server outage points strongly towards a potential \"Hardware\" issue, but I'm also considering other possibilities given the limited information. I'll need to carefully analyze the provided list of categories to choose the most appropriate one. This is key.\n\n\n**Pinpointing Root Cause**\n\nThe ticket analysis continues. I've broken down the complaint: server failures indicate a \"Hardware\" or potentially a \"Storage\" issue. It's difficult to say for sure without more info, but I'm leaning toward hardware as the primary root cause. Recurrence suggests a systemic problem. Prevention is the key goal. The categorization process is evolving.\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nMy focus has shifted slightly, though it is still on refining the ticket category. \"Hardware\" still seems like the primary fit based on the server outage. I've re-evaluated \"Miscellaneous\", but given the symptoms, it's more appropriate to consider the core server issue before any system-level root causes. I'm satisfied that \"Hardware\" best addresses the presented problem.\n\n\n"
