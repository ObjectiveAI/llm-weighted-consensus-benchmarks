The details of the ticket point towards a potential hardware issue, since it mentions phones and conference rooms (Neptune, Mercury) and call quality. However, HR Support is also a potential possibility since the issue could affect employee communications. I'll carefully consider the available options to select the most relevant category from \"Hardware|HR Support|Access|Miscellaneous|Storage|Purchase|Internal Project|Administrative rights\".\n\n\n**Narrowing Down Options**\n\nI've refined my thinking by focusing on the core issue: degraded communication quality. This narrowed it down to hardware and HR support as the likely options. I then meticulously cross-referenced the provided information - phones, conference rooms - with the available categories. It seems the ticket clearly pertains to a hardware problem. Thus, my choice lands firmly on \"Hardware\".\n\n\n"
