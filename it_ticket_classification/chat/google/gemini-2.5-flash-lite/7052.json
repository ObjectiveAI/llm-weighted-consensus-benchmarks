The phrases \"password reset\" and \"expire days\" are leading me to think this is related to Access, as in account access management. The generic \"hi guys please\" is non-specific and doesn't change my current reasoning. I will proceed with Access as the likely answer.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Ticket**\n\nThe keywords \"password reset\" and \"expire days\" continue to point towards \"Access.\" While \"change pc\" and the mention of \"ctrl alt delete\" initially seemed like hardware or administrative tasks, the context strongly suggests a user access issue. The focus is on a password reset, making \"Access\" the most logical category.\n\n\n**Identifying Ticket Type**\n\nI've determined the ticket concerns a password reset and expiration, placing it firmly within the \"Access\" category. While the mention of \"change pc\" and \"ctrl alt delete\" momentarily introduced doubt, the overarching context of password management makes \"Access\" the indisputable choice. The analysis solidified this categorization, steering away from other possibilities.\n\n\n"
