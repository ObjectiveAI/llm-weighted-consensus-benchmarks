My focus is on identifying the most accurate category from the given schema, evaluating options like Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, and Internal to ensure proper routing.\n\n**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nI'm refining the categorization for the IT ticket concerning meeting room extensions. My current thinking leans towards \"Hardware\" as the most appropriate classification, considering the technical nature of assigning extensions, whether for networking, telephony, or AV equipment, all of which fall under tangible IT components.\n\n**Selecting IT Ticket Category**\n\nI'm refining the classification for the IT ticket regarding meeting room extensions. After reviewing the context of assigning extensions, potentially for networking, telephony, or AV equipment, and considering the involvement of infrastructure engineers, \"Hardware\" appears to be the most fitting category, encompassing the tangible IT components involved.\n\n**Choosing IT Ticket Category**\n\nI'm finalizing my assessment of the IT ticket concerning meeting room extensions. Considering the involvement of infrastructure engineers and the potential need for physical network ports, cabling, or AV/telephony hardware to establish these extensions, I've concluded that \"Hardware\" is the most fitting classification.\n\n"
