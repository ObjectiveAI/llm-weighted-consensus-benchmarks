The phrase \"resolve him\" sounds vague, however, combined with \"add his\" and \"mandatory,\" I think it might be about access rights. I need to be more precise.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and the keywords \"resolve him,\" \"add his,\" and \"mandatory submit\" are the most revealing, suggesting an access problem. \"Deleted sheets\" and \"closed sheet error\" reinforce this. The phrase \"update\" can mean there are permissions needed to edit existing sheets. All this points towards administrative rights or issues accessing files, further solidifying my hypothesis that the correct category is either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\"\n\n\n**Finalizing Category Selection**\n\nMy focus has sharpened to \"Access.\" Considering the new evidence, like the \"error status\" and the repeated inability to \"submit\" or \"approve,\" it's clear the core issue revolves around user permissions. \"Resolve him\" and \"add his\" suggest resolving issues with access. The broad nature of \"Access\" aligns best with the ticket's issues compared to the narrower scope of \"Administrative rights.\" The overall theme of restricted system interaction confirms the \"Access\" category.\n\n\n**Categorizing Ticket Issues**\n\nI'm now fully immersed in the keywords. \"Resolve him,\" \"add his,\" and particularly the repeated \"submit\" and \"approve\" phrases, coupled with \"error status,\" highlight permission problems. \"Deleted sheets\" and \"closed sheet error\" solidify the access-related issue. My analysis strongly points to the \"Access\" category, as it encapsulates system interaction limitations far better than \"Administrative rights.\" The overall theme is system usability and restricted actions, confirming my selection.\n\n\n**Finalizing Ticket Categorization**\n\nMy latest analysis of the ticket's keywords, particularly \"mandatory submit,\" \"nor submit nor approve,\" and \"sheet error,\" solidified my decision. \"Resolve him\" and \"add his\" suggest resolving access issues. Though \"Administrative rights\" is a contender, \"Access\" best encompasses all aspects of system interaction limitations, confirming my choice of \"Access\" as the core issue.\n\n\n"
