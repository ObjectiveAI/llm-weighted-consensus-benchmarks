The wording \"restrict access\" points strongly toward \"Access\", given the context of a folder restriction. While it could touch on administrative rights, the core issue is the access restriction, so that's the primary focus I'm selecting.\n\n\n**Clarifying Access Concerns**\n\nI've solidified my stance on categorizing this ticket. The phrases \"restrict access\" and \"need access\" dominate the text, pinpointing the \"Access\" category as the most accurate fit. It's a fundamental access control issue, even with mention of a folder creation, the root is access.\n\n\n"
