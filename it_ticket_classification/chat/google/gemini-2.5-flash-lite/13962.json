My goal is to pinpoint keywords that will help me accurately assign it to one of the predefined categories. This involves a close examination of the provided text to ensure the best fit.\n\n**Classifying Ticket Content**\n\nI'm currently reviewing the provided ticket text to identify the most relevant keywords. My aim is to accurately assign the ticket to the appropriate category from the given list. The presence of terms like \"maternity form\" and \"hardware\" suggests a need to consider both HR and IT aspects.\n\n**Assigning Ticket Category**\n\nI'm processing the details of the IT ticket, focusing on the prominent mentions of \"maternity form\" and \"hardware.\" My analysis indicates that while hardware is involved, the core request revolves around employee status and HR procedures, leading me to classify it as HR Support.\n\n**Classifying Ticket Request**\n\nI'm currently processing the provided ticket text, focusing on the recurring mentions of \"maternity form\" and the instruction to manage \"hardware\" and account status related to a \"maternity leaver.\" My analysis points towards HR Support as the most fitting category, as the IT actions requested are in direct support of HR-driven employee status changes.\n\n**Classifying Employee Leave**\n\nI'm currently refining my analysis of the ticket's core intent. While \"hardware\" and account status are mentioned, the pervasive theme of \"maternity form\" and \"maternity leaver\" strongly indicates that the primary driver is an HR process, positioning HR Support as the most fitting classification.\n\n"
