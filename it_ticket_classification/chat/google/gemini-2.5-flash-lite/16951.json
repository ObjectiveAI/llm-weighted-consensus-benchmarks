                    "reasoning": "**Identifying Ticket Type**\n\nI've been analyzing the ticket text and it seems to involve changes to a public address related to planned infrastructure work. I'm leaning toward \"Access\" as the most suitable category because it points to alterations in how users or systems access the network. My current thought is to confirm that this is not related to internal projects or hardware, given the available information.\n\n\n**Re-evaluating Category Selection**\n\nI'm reconsidering the initial \"Access\" categorization. After further reflection on the IP address range changes, network management is the main focus. \"Network Management\" feels more precise than \"Access\" now. The updates to the public address and the impact on teams point to a need to revisit access control measures.\n\n\n**Refining Categorization Focus**\n\nThe ticket's core issue is the public IP address range change for planned infrastructure work impacting various teams. I am currently honing in on how this directly relates to the network itself. While access is a factor, the change's nature leans more toward network configuration and management. \"Network Management\" feels most accurate but isn't an option. I am reconsidering whether the \"planned works\" could categorize this as an \"Internal Project\".\n\n\n**Pinpointing Ticket Focus**\n\nMy focus is narrowing in on the essence of the ticket: a public IP address change linked to infrastructure enhancements and impacting various teams and external parties. The \"planned works\" hint at project involvement, but the immediate concern appears to be the implications of the IP address modifications.  I'm weighing \"Internal Project\" versus \"Access\" considering the user's intent: is this a notification of a project or a call to address access implications.\n\n\n**Categorizing Ticket Essence**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the best category for this ticket, and the \"Internal Project\" option is coming into view. The address change is central. While \"Access\" could apply to any user impact, the \"planned works infrastructure\" context suggests this could be part of a larger, defined initiative. My concern is the impact of the address range changes on teams and external parties, and this sounds like a planned and managed activity.\n\n\n**Determining Primary Focus**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the best category for this ticket, and the \"Internal Project\" option is coming into view. The address change is central. While \"Access\" could apply to any user impact, the \"planned works infrastructure\" context suggests this could be part of a larger, defined initiative. My concern is the impact of the address range changes on teams and external parties, and this sounds like a planned and managed activity. I am leaning toward the category \"Internal Project\". The \"planned works infrastructure\" could be categorized under \"Internal Project\". The other option is \"Access\" since teams might lose access, but there seems to be a larger context that favors \"Internal Project.\" The user is either notifying or asking to have things configured for changes in the IP address range for infrastructure work and the associated impact.\n\n\n**Defining Ticket Category**\n\nMy current thinking is that this ticket is best categorized as \"Internal Project.\" While the IP address change impacts access, the \"planned works infrastructure\" context implies a larger initiative. The text itself signals an update regarding an internal project, and the \"Access\" concerns are secondary to this planned work.\n\n\n**Selecting Ticket Category**\n\nMy current assessment is that the \"Internal Project\" category best reflects the ticket's focus. Although access concerns might arise, the primary emphasis is the public IP address range change within the context of planned infrastructure work. I've considered that the change is more than just access, it is an infrastructure element change that needs management.\n\n"
