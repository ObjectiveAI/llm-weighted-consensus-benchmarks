The recurring mention of \"change\" is a primary clue I'm working with.\n\n**Classifying the Request**\n\nI've analyzed the ticket's phrasing, noting repeated references to \"changing,\" \"requesting,\" and \"replacing\" desktop and laptop machines. This clearly points towards the need for new equipment. Based on this, I'm confident the most appropriate category is \"Hardware.\"\n\n**Confirming Category**\n\nI've reviewed the available categories and concluded that \"Hardware\" remains the most accurate classification for this ticket, given its direct focus on requesting new or replacement computer equipment.\n\n"
