I am proceeding to make the determination.\n\n\n**Analyzing the Ticket Category**\n\nI've determined that the appropriate category for the IT ticket is \"Hardware.\" This decision is based on the ticket's explicit mention of \"audio driver\" which directly points to hardware components. While other categories were considered, \"Hardware\" is the most specific and accurate.\n\n\n"
