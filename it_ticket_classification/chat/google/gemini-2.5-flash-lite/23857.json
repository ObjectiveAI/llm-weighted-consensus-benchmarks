After examining the keywords (\"hardware,\" \"equipment\") and context (new employee), I am leaning towards \"Hardware\" as the primary concern. I am still considering other possible categories.\n\n\n**Revising Category Choice**\n\nI have re-evaluated the initial \"Hardware\" categorization. While the initial focus on \"hardware equipment allocated\" seemed conclusive, I've broadened my perspective, considering the user's need for advice as well. It's clear that HR processes are involved, but the IT action is equipment allocation. Now I'm leaning more strongly toward \"Hardware.\"\n\n\n**Analyzing Ticket Details**\n\nI have analyzed the IT ticket text and determined that the core request involves allocating hardware equipment to a new employee. Key phrases such as \"hardware equipment allocated\" and \"new starter\" led me to consider \"Hardware\" as the most suitable category. I evaluated other categories but found them less relevant because the ticket explicitly seeks IT assistance with hardware allocation.\n\n\n"
