I'm focusing on key phrases and keywords within the ticket description to align it with predefined options like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" The goal is to develop a reliable system for automatic ticket categorization.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Incident**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the \"HR Support\" category, given the strong signals from keywords such as \"maternity leaves\" and \"suspended contracts.\" The \"Oracle mistakes and updates\" detail, coupled with \"affects reports,\" suggests potential data integrity concerns that *might* bridge into other categories, but the HR context is primary. I'm carefully weighing how to account for this data overlap in my categorization logic.\n\n\n**Pinpointing Ticket Classification**\n\nMy assessment now prioritizes the HR aspect of the ticket. The core issue revolves around data linked to \"maternity leaves\" and \"suspended contracts,\" which strongly indicates an \"HR Support\" category.  The \"Oracle mistakes\" and \"affects reports\" elements are now seen as a consequence within the HR data system. I am solidifying this categorization.\n\n\n"
