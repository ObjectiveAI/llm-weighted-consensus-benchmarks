The \"time card error\" and \"leave submission problem\" point towards either HR Support or a system Access issue. I'm leaning towards HR Support as the primary issue seems to revolve around HR-related functions, but I will continue to think on it.\n\n\n**Defining the Scope**\n\nI've determined that the described ticket strongly pertains to HR Support rather than hardware or system access. The details emphasize timekeeping, leave submissions, and related errors. I'm confident HR Support is the core issue, as the user is clearly facing problems with these HR-centric functions.\n\n\n"
