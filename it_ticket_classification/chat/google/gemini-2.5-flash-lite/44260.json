The \"double booking conference rooms\" issue is tricky, as it touches upon several potential areas. My initial instinct leans towards \"Access\" or potentially \"Miscellaneous\", but I'm weighing whether it fits better under \"Storage\" because of room availability management. I'm exploring how it relates to general administrative function, also.\n\n\n**Finalizing Classification Strategy**\n\nI've re-examined the categories, and \"Access\" isn't a perfect fit, though booking availability is related. \"Miscellaneous\" appears the best fit for now, as the core problem is a system error in scheduling, not a specific access right. I'm satisfied with this decision unless further information surfaces that highlights a more precise category. The ticket should now have a classification to be routed forward.\n\n\n**Confirming Classification Decision**\n\nI've carefully considered the given categories. While \"Access\" had a potential link due to resource availability, the core of the issue is a scheduling conflict, not access rights per se. I've re-examined the examples and determined that \"Miscellaneous\" is the most accurate fit given the defined options. The problem is a system malfunction causing scheduling issues, best captured by the miscellaneous label.\n\n\n"
