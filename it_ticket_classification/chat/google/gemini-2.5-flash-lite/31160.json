My analysis of phrases like \"pricing request for infrastructure\" and \"pricing information\" is leading me towards a specific, suitable selection.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Best Fit**\n\nI'm now carefully examining the ticket's language, identifying phrases related to \"wireless controllers,\" \"licensing,\" and \"client subsidiaries.\" It's becoming clearer that the primary concern isn't just about hardware issues but the acquisition and pricing of infrastructure components.  I've systematically ruled out categories like \"HR Support\" and \"Administrative rights.\" \"Purchase\" is looking like the winner, given the emphasis on pricing information for new components.\n\n\n"
