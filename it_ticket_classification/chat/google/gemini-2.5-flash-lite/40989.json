I'm planning on adding the most likely categories to the prompt to evaluate the next step.\n\n\n**Determining the best fit**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's content, focusing on keywords related to annual leave and absence records. After a comprehensive review of all the categories available, from Hardware to Administrative rights, I've concluded that \"HR Support\" is the most accurate classification. I'm now ready to provide this categorization in the requested JSON format.\n\n\n"
