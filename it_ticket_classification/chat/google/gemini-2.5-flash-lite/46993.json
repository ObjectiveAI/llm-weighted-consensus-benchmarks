The key terms suggest this is likely a hardware-related issue, possibly a cable problem. Therefore, I am leaning toward \"Hardware\" as the best fit, but I need to do a thorough analysis to rule out possibilities, or any other categories it may fall under.\n\n\n**Revisiting Category Assignment**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket text with a fine-tooth comb, and the \"cable\" issue continues to scream \"Hardware.\" The phrases \"intermittent issues\" and the implied physical nature of the problem solidify my initial assessment. I've re-mapped the ticket's keywords against all categories, and nothing else makes logical sense. This reinforces my confidence in \"Hardware\" as the definitive categorization.\n\n\n"
