The mention of \"desks\" might relate to hardware, but the lack of specific context makes it difficult to definitively rule out other possibilities. I'm leaning toward \"Hardware\" but need more information to be sure.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Options**\n\nI've been analyzing the text in more detail, searching for definitive keywords. \"SD area\" doesn't immediately suggest a category, but \"desks,\" \"running battery,\" and \"extra screens\" strongly indicate hardware. I've ruled out the other categories, as they don't seem applicable based on the available information. I'm now certain \"Hardware\" is the correct category.\n\n\n"
