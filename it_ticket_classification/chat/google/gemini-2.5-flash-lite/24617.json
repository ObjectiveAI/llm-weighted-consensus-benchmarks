I've taken the first step of identifying the core list of possible categories. I'm now reading the input text and attempting to relate it to the possible categories. Next I'll attempt to relate the input to the categories.\n\n\n**Identifying Key Themes**\n\nI've been poring over the text snippets, highlighting keywords and phrases. I'm seeing recurring themes of interns, accounts, planning, and administration. I'm focusing on the nature of these interactions to determine the primary category. Is it about access, HR, or is it more administrative? I am leaning toward a combination of HR Support and Administrative rights.\n\n\n**Prioritizing HR Activities**\n\nI've been analyzing the text snippets focusing on the common thread of interns, HR processes, and administrative involvement. The data strongly suggests an HR support function is central to these tickets. My analysis now points towards \"HR Support\" as the primary categorization for these tickets, though the \"Access\" category may play a secondary role.\n\n\n**Focusing On Onboarding**\n\nI've been examining the text snippets thoroughly, noting the prominent role of new interns and related procedures. Specifically, I see these tickets predominantly revolve around onboarding processes, covering paperwork, contracts, and access provision. This strongly reinforces that \"HR Support\" is the primary category, with \"Access\" a relevant sub-category within that broader context.\n\n\n"
