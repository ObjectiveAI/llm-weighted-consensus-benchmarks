Keywords like \"new interns\" and \"graduates program\" seem key to the analysis. I'm leaning toward a category related to user access or onboarding, but I'm cross-referencing to ensure complete accuracy before committing.\n\n\n**Selecting the Best Fit**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's content, focusing on terms like \"new interns,\" \"graduates program,\" and the need for resource access. My analysis points strongly towards the \"HR Support\" category, as the primary theme is related to onboarding new personnel. This choice aligns well with the provided context and best reflects the nature of the request.\n\n\n**Defining the Best Match**\n\nI've reviewed the ticket text, emphasizing keywords like \"interns,\" \"graduates,\" and resource requests. My analysis strongly suggests \"HR Support\" as the ideal category. The core issue involves facilitating the onboarding of new personnel, which aligns perfectly with the \"HR Support\" label. The other categories seem less relevant, as the ticket focuses on the general setup and readiness for these new hires.\n\n\n"
