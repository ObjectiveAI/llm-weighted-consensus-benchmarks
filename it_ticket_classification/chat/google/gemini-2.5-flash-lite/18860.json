The phrasing \"new starter\" and the mention of administration makes me think this falls under \"HR Support\" or maybe \"Administrative Rights,\" but I'm leaning toward the former for now.\n\n\n**Choosing the Best Fit**\n\nI'm now fully committed to \"HR Support\" as the ideal category for the IT ticket. Despite the presence of administrative aspects, \"new starter\" unequivocally steers me towards HR-related onboarding. The other phrases seem subsidiary to this primary focus. It's a confident selection!\n\n\n**Selecting the Best Category**\n\nI'm now fully confident in choosing \"HR Support\" for this ticket. The phrases point heavily toward onboarding, making this category the most precise fit. The mention of administrative tasks also supports this choice, as HR often handles onboarding-related paperwork and access. This decision reflects a complete understanding of IT ticket classification.\n\n\n"
