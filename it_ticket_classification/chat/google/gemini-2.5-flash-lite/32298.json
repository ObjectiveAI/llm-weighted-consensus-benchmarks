The initial phrase \"meeting rooms cables\" points towards a potential hardware issue or possibly even a storage need related to equipment. My focus is on determining the primary intent of the request before moving to category selection.\n\n\n**Defining Equipment Needs**\n\nI've been meticulously examining the ticket content, and the recurrence of \"cables\" and related terms is striking. I've compiled a list of keywords and their context. Replacing, testing, and managing cables, along with their accessories, is clearly the primary focus. I'm leaning toward \"Hardware\" as the most suitable category.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Hardware Maintenance**\n\nMy analysis of the ticket content continues to solidify \"Hardware\" as the most appropriate category. The recurring themes of cable replacement, testing, restocking, and general management point directly towards physical equipment concerns. I've considered other categories, but the emphasis on hardware maintenance is overwhelmingly evident. The phrase, \"cable less meeting rooms\" is likely related to the need to install or maintain cables.\n\n\n"
