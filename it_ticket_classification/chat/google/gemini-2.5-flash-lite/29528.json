The keywords \"leaver form,\" \"leaver bulk form,\" and \"disable cards\" suggest a strong lean toward an HR-related access issue. I'm carefully considering the available categories and weighing whether \"HR Support\" or \"Access\" best fits the primary intent of this ticket.\n\n\n**Analyzing the Primary Driver**\n\nI've refined my thinking by focusing on the core intent. While access is a component, the fundamental issue revolves around processing leaver forms. This emphasizes the HR process more than the technical act of disabling cards, leading me to lean towards \"HR Support.\" It's becoming clearer that the \"Access\" aspect is a consequence of the HR-driven leaver process, and not the primary driver.\n\n\n**Finalizing the Selection**\n\nI've decided to finalize the category selection. After assessing all factors, I'm confident that \"HR Support\" is the most appropriate choice. While the ticket involves revoking access, the central issue is the processing of leaver forms, and this falls squarely within HR's domain. The \"disable cards\" part is a consequence of the HR process, not the main objective of the ticket. The selection process highlights how understanding the core driver is key.\n\n\n"
