My focus is on identifying keywords that will allow me to assign it to the most fitting category from the available options like Hardware, HR Support, Access, or Miscellaneous.\n\n**Assigning Ticket Category**\n\nI've reviewed the ticket details and the available categories. Based on the repeated mentions of \"cannot access,\" \"logging,\" and \"signing,\" I'm strongly leaning towards classifying this as an \"Access\" issue. It seems the core problem revolves around users being unable to log in or utilize specific functionalities, rather than a hardware defect or other general support need.\n\n"
