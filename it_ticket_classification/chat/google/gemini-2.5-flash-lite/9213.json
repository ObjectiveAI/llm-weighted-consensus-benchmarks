The text is brief and appears to be requesting a password reset. Based on my analysis, it seems the most suitable category is \"Access\".\n\n\n**Refining Category Assignment**\n\nI'm now diving deeper into the ticket text to refine the category assignment. The inclusion of \"change pc\" adds complexity. While it could relate to hardware, the context leans more towards access problems due to the password reset request and \"received error.\" I'm also considering the \"expire today\" aspect, further solidifying the access-related nature of the issue. I am excluding the non-related categories.\n\n\n**Analyzing Ticket Context**\n\nI'm now focusing on the ticket text. While \"change pc\" could suggest hardware, the presence of \"reset password,\" \"expire today,\" and \"received error\" point strongly towards access problems. I've ruled out HR Support, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights.  I've decided to exclude the non-related parts, such as disclaimers. Access seems to encapsulate the core issue.\n\n\n**Concluding Category Assignment**\n\nThe ticket's core issue, a password reset and associated errors upon PC change, solidifies my conclusion. While \"change pc\" initially suggested Hardware, the context points to access hurdles. I've successfully isolated the primary access-related elements, excluding irrelevant disclaimers, and reconfirmed \"Access\" as the definitive category. This assignment reflects the root cause of the ticket.\n\n\n"
