The initial analysis suggests it's related to Oracle and potentially location changes, however the full list of phrases is needed to confirm the category. The list of allowed categories is: \"Hardware|HR Support|Access|Miscellaneous|Storage|Purchase|Internal Project|Administrative rights\".\n\n\n**Revising the Classification**\n\nI've re-evaluated the categorization. While initially considering \"Miscellaneous\" and even briefly \"Storage\" given the mention of infrastructure, I'm now leaning towards \"Internal Project\". The \"closing down plan\" context strongly suggests a broader organizational initiative rather than a standard IT request. The location deactivation seems a part of a larger project, making \"Internal Project\" the most accurate fit.\n\n\n**Finalizing the Classification**\n\nI've confirmed the \"Internal Project\" classification. The repeated phrase \"closing down plan,\" combined with the specific action of setting a location inactive, clarifies this as a project concerning infrastructure decommissioning. This isn't a simple access issue, hardware request, or other standard IT ticket. It's a structured organizational change, thus, the \"Internal Project\" classification is appropriate.\n\n\n"
