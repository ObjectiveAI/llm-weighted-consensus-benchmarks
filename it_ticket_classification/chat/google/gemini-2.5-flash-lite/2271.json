After a quick scan, \"Hardware\" seems like the most fitting option. The text mentions a \"new mouse request\" and describes the current mouse as \"behaving weird\". This strongly indicates a hardware-related issue or request. I'll need to confirm that this is the best fit, perhaps by considering if other options fit better.\n\n\n**Finalizing Category Selection**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's text, identifying key phrases like \"new mouse request\" and \"behaving weird\". Initially, \"Hardware\" seemed like the frontrunner, and my analysis solidified this. The phrases related to availability and running out might suggest a procurement angle, but the central need is a mouse, a hardware component. After evaluating the schema, \"Hardware\" emerged as the most precise fit, effectively capturing the essence of the ticket.\n\n\n**Evaluating Alternative Categories**\n\nMy thinking has moved toward a more refined evaluation of the categories, moving beyond the obvious hardware label. While the initial impulse led toward \"Hardware,\" I've been giving some thought to the nuances. The mention of \"availability\" makes me consider \"Purchase,\" but the core request *is* a mouse. \"Purchase\" feels less accurate than \"Hardware\" since the central action needed involves physical equipment. This means my choice of \"Hardware\" as the central category feels correct.\n\n\n"
