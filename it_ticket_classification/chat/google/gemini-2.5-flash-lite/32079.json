I'm analyzing keywords to determine the best fit.\n\n**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm evaluating the core intent of the ticket, which seems to strongly relate to procurement processes based on keywords like \"purchase requisition.\" While hardware is mentioned, the emphasis on the requisition workflow steers me towards a more fitting classification.\n\n**Prioritizing Procurement Workflow**\n\nI've refined my understanding of the ticket's core intent. While a laptop is requested, the recurring emphasis on \"purchase requisition,\" \"allocation,\" and the distinction between temporary and permanent needs clearly points to the procurement process as the primary classification. Therefore, \"Purchase\" is the most appropriate category.\n\n**Refining Category Assignment**\n\nI'm finalizing my classification of the ticket. While the item requested is a laptop, the core process described, with repeated mentions of \"purchase requisition,\" \"allocation,\" and the distinction between temporary and permanent needs, firmly places it under the \"Purchase\" category.\n\n"
