The repeated mentions of \"requisition returned by buyer\" and the reference to \"headphones\" are key. I'm leaning heavily towards \"Purchase\" based on these details. I will assess whether this is the best fit for the context or not.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Scope**\n\nI've refined the initial category selection. The \"Purchase\" option now seems even more fitting given the recurring theme of procurement and order fulfillment. The ticket's language, including \"requisition,\" \"order pending,\" and \"allocate equipment,\" solidifies this conclusion. I will proceed with this classification.\n\n\n"
