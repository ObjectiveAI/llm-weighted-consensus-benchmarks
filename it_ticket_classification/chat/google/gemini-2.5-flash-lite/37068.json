My process involves analyzing the ticket's text, looking for keywords like \"crash\" and \"c\", to accurately assign it to one of the following categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, or Administrative rights.\n\n**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI've analyzed the ticket's content, noting numerous terms related to system crashes, CPU, kernel, and specific hardware components like drivers, graphics, and processors. Based on this, I've concluded the most appropriate category is \"Hardware.\"\n\n**Refining Category Assignment**\n\nI'm solidifying the categorization of the IT ticket. My analysis strongly indicates the \"Hardware\" category due to the prevalence of terms related to system instability, component failures, drivers, and core processing units.\n\n"
