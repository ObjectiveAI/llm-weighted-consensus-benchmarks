The text is a bit unclear, but I'm leaning towards \"Hardware\" as the primary issue seems to be a performance problem, with mentions of projects and dashboards not functioning well. I'm exploring the nuances to make the best call.\n\n\n**Assessing Access Concerns**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on an access-related issue. The phrase \"used to have access\" and \"valid for other users\" is a strong indicator. While initial focus wavered, this new data point aligns perfectly with the \"Access\" category, and the described performance problem may stem from improperly configured permissions.\n\n\n**Confirming Access Issues**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket details, pinpointing \"Access\" as the dominant concern. The phrase \"used have access\" and the issue's replication across users solidify this. While initial uncertainty existed, the evidence strongly supports an access restriction. The reported poor functionality seems to be a symptom of this core access problem.\n\n\n"
