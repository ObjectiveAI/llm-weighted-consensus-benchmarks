My initial thought is leaning towards \"Access,\" as the issue seems to be centered around authorization. However, I need to be absolutely certain before finalizing my categorization. I'm carefully reviewing the options to ensure no subtle nuance points towards a different category.\n\n\n**Reviewing Authorization Options**\n\nI'm now prioritizing the \"Administrative rights\" category alongside \"Access\". The error message \"log with more privileges\" is crucial. It strongly suggests the need for elevated permissions, making \"Administrative rights\" a very relevant option. I'm carefully comparing the nuances between the two categories to determine the most accurate classification, considering whether the user needs access to a resource generally available, or if they need specific elevated access.\n\n\n**Categorizing Access Issue**\n\nI've considered all the options, focusing particularly on \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights.\" The key phrases \"not authorized to access sonar\" and \"log with more privileges\" solidify my leaning towards \"Access.\" While administrative rights might be involved, the core issue is the user's inability to access the system. The message indicates authorization is the root issue, thus making \"Access\" the ideal category, rather than a more specific rights request. I'm now certain this is the best categorization for this ticket.\n\n\n"
