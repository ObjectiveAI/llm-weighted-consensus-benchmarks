Keywords like \"install,\" \"reinstall,\" \"upgrade,\" and \"machines\" keep surfacing, making \"Hardware\" seem like a strong contender. However, I need to be more precise before concluding; \"Internal Project\" is also a consideration. I'm focusing on the context to differentiate.\n\n\n**Solidifying the Decision**\n\nI've honed in on the \"Hardware\" category, and the keywords solidify this. \"Install,\" \"reinstall,\" and \"upgrade,\" coupled with terms like \"workstations\" and \"assets,\" all point towards hardware-related tasks. While \"Internal Project\" could apply in some contexts, the core issue revolves around physical device management, making \"Hardware\" the superior fit. I've now ruled out the other options definitively, confident in my assessment.\n\n\n"
