I'm leaning toward \"HR Support\" but will assess all other options to be sure there isn't another relevant label.\n\n\n**Reaching a Conclusion**\n\nI've analyzed the ticket text, \"annual leave called asking works she wants submit leave sheet tomorrow,\" and meticulously weighed it against each category. \"Hardware\", \"Access\", and others were easily dismissed as irrelevant. The phrase \"annual leave\" and the request for leave submission clearly point to \"HR Support.\" This seems the most specific and logical fit. Therefore, I confidently categorize this ticket as \"HR Support.\"\n\n\n"
