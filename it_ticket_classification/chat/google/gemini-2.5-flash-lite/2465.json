I've ruled out \"Hardware\" as a category since it doesn't align with the described symptoms. My attention is now focused on identifying the best-fit IT ticket category.\n\n\n**Defining the Best Fit**\n\nI've carefully considered the IT ticket and its symptoms. The persistent password reset issue points squarely at an \"Access\" problem, excluding \"Hardware\" which is irrelevant. \"Administrative rights\" is close, but \"Access\" is more fitting. The user is locked out due to password issues, so this choice seems right.\n\n\n"
