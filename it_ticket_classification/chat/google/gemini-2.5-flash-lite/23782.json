The phrase \"new starter\" strongly suggests this issue falls under the category of onboarding, likely related to HR Support or Access provisioning. I need to determine if it is more about access or HR processes.\n\n\n**Defining Categorization Logic**\n\nI've refined my approach to categorize the IT ticket. Analyzing the text, I've identified keywords like \"new starter\" and \"joining\", strongly indicating onboarding. While \"access\" is relevant, \"HR Support\" appears to be the broader category, encapsulating the initial setup. I'm focusing on the core request: setting up a new employee, which aligns more closely with HR processes. The developer's need for access is implicit within this context.\n\n\n**Determining the Primary Category**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket text with the available categories in mind. While \"Access\" is relevant, I believe \"HR Support\" is the overarching category. The \"new starter\" aspect strongly aligns with HR's onboarding process, and IT's role is to facilitate this. The details about a completed form and a compliance officer further support this categorization, solidifying my decision.\n\n\n"
