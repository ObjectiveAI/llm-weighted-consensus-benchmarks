My analysis leans towards \"Access\" as the primary issue seems related to a missing button within a software interface. The reference to \"Oracle Fusion\" strengthens this categorization, as it often involves access permissions. I'm carefully considering whether \"Internal Project\" might also apply, but it seems less directly relevant given the focus on a single access point. I'm weighing the nuances to ensure the most accurate classification.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Issue**\n\nThe focus has shifted to \"Miscellaneous.\" While the missing button indirectly affects access, the core problem lies within the Oracle Fusion application's functionality itself. Analyzing the text, a software bug is the primary culprit, not a permissions problem, and \"Miscellaneous\" aligns better than \"Access\" or \"Internal Project\". The context of a \"missing submit button\" within an application session strengthens this conclusion.\n\n\n**Defining the Category**\n\nI've re-evaluated the category, settling on \"Miscellaneous.\" Initially, I considered \"Access,\" given the button's role, but after careful review, the core problem is a software bug in Oracle Fusion. It's not about lacking access permissions; it's a functional issue within an existing session. The \"Miscellaneous\" category best captures this. The attached screenshot and Chrome version suggest this.\n\n\n"
