The time sheet mention points away from hardware, storage, or purchase. \"Internal Project\" is unlikely, too. Administrative rights also feels a stretch. The user's time sheet issue and the failed notification strongly suggest an HR system/process is involved. \"HR Support\" seems like the most fitting category. This should resolve the ticket.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Culprit**\n\nI've honed in on the HR Support category. The time sheet and notification failure are solid indicators, ruling out hardware, storage, purchases, internal projects, and administrative rights. It's definitely not a miscellaneous issue. The user's description points directly to a system or process integral to HR operations. This should be an open-and-shut case.\n\n\n"
