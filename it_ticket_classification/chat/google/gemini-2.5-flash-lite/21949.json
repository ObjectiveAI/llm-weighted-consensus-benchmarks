Terms like \"new starters,\" \"accounts created,\" and \"leavers\" clearly point towards user onboarding and offboarding, a realm firmly within HR's purview. While \"Access\" is relevant, \"HR Support\" offers a broader context for the user account lifecycle.\n\n\n**Determining Ticket's Focus**\n\nAfter reviewing the ticket details again, I've confirmed that the primary concern centers on user onboarding and offboarding. Terms like \"credentials,\" \"groups,\" and \"file updates\" all link back to account management within the context of hiring and termination, solidifying \"HR Support\" as the most suitable category, as it captures the comprehensive nature of these requests. The inclusion of contractors further emphasizes the personnel-related scope.\n\n\n"
