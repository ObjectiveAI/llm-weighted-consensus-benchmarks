While \"Miscellaneous\" initially seemed plausible, I'm now considering \"Purchase\" as a stronger fit given the recurring \"expense request\" theme and the mention of approval workflows, suggesting a financial transaction process.\n\n**Evaluating Ticket Content**\n\nI'm currently reassessing the ticket's classification. The strong emphasis on \"expense request\" and the mention of \"approval\" workflows lead me to believe \"Purchase\" is a more precise category than the initial \"Miscellaneous\" consideration.\n\n**Finalizing Ticket Category**\n\nI've concluded that \"Purchase\" is the most accurate classification for this IT ticket. The recurring \"expense request\" theme, coupled with the details about approval workflows and redirection, strongly points to a financial transaction process rather than a general \"Miscellaneous\" item.\n\n"
