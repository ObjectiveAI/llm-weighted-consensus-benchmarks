I'm leaning towards \"HR Support\" or potentially \"Access\" if it involves access to company systems. I'm focusing on the keywords to determine the correct category.\n\n\n**Determining Category Now**\n\nMy analysis indicates this ticket is related to a new employee. I'm focusing on \"HR Support\" as the main category, as it aligns with onboarding and form processing. While \"Access\" is relevant, the core issue seems to be the starter form and associated procedures, suggesting HR involvement. \"Prolonged leave\" adds to the HR angle. I'm finalizing my decision now.\n\n\n**Refining Ticket Categorization**\n\nMy focus has shifted again to the \"HR Support\" category, as I've solidified the link between the \"new starter,\" \"starter form,\" and potential \"prolonged leave\" details, which all heavily point towards HR processes. While \"Access\" is still a relevant consideration, the emphasis remains on onboarding documentation and associated workflows. This seems to be the core concern of the ticket. I am close to finalizing this categorization.\n\n\n"
