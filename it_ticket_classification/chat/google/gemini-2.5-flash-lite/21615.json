I see \"leaver\" and \"leave\", which leans toward an HR context, so I'm leaning toward \"HR Support\". The other categories don't seem to fit as well.  The process seems straightforward, so I am ready to finalize the classification.\n\n\n**Analyzing the Keywords**\n\nI've been drilling down on the keywords and it's crystal clear that this is about a departing employee. The use of \"leaver\" and associated terms throughout the text confirms an HR-related scenario. No other category seems appropriate. I'm ready to mark this as HR Support.\n\n\n**Defining the Scope**\n\nI've carefully reviewed the text and it's definitely about deactivating a departing employee's access. The details about mailboxes, profiles, and AD rights solidify this. While HR might be involved, the core issue is the technical execution of revoking access. I'm leaning heavily toward \"Access\" as the most suitable category.\n\n\n**Narrowing the Focus**\n\nIt's evident the main thrust is deactivating access, not just the offboarding paperwork, so I've leaned hard towards \"Access\". I'm convinced the technical actions\u2014AD rights, mailboxes, profiles\u2014are the core of the ticket. While HR is involved, the focus here is the IT work of revoking access.\n\n\n"
