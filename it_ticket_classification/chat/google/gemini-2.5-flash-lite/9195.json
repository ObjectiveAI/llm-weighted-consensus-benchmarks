After analyzing the provided text, which includes mentions of \"new starter\" and \"Colombia,\" I'm leaning toward either HR Support or Access as the best fit. I'm carefully weighing these options to ensure the most accurate categorization for this request.\n\n\n**Pinpointing Ticket Category**\n\nI'm now fully immersed in nailing down the right category. \"New starter\" and \"completed form\" are flashing bright HR signals. While \"seated\" *could* hint at hardware setup, HR seems like the dominant theme. I'm focusing on \"joining\" and \"compliance officer Colombia\" too, as these add weight to the HR bucket. Right now, HR Support feels like the best fit, but I'm open to further refinement.\n\n\n**Confirming Ticket Type**\n\nI'm solidifying my approach and confirming the category. The ticket text strongly implies HR Support. While \"seated\" nudged me towards Hardware setup, I've confirmed that the primary concern is facilitating onboarding. The phrases \"new starter,\" \"joining,\" and \"completed form\" are overwhelmingly HR-focused, solidifying HR Support as the right label. This ticket seems centered on the essential onboarding procedures.\n\n\n"
