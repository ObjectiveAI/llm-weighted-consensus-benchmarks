Since the text mentions access, but lacks further context, I will focus on the Access category.\n\n\n**Defining the Core Problem**\n\nI'm now prioritizing the \"Access\" category as the most fitting. The provided text details access problems post-infrastructure changes. This highlights a direct correlation between the changes and the user's inability to connect, solidifying my decision. I am eliminating irrelevant categories and focusing on \"Access\" as the central theme of the ticket. The phrase \"unable to be accessed\" is a key indicator.\n\n\n**Confirming Access Focus**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's content and the available categories. It is clear to me now that the core issue revolves around access. The repeated phrases \"unable to be accessed\" and the mention of \"wired connection\" and \"infrastructure changes\" confirm my initial inclination. After meticulously evaluating all provided context, \"Access\" is the most appropriate category, and I am satisfied with this conclusion.\n\n\n"
