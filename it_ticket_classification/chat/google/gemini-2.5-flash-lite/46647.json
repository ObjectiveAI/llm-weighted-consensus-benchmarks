The \"expense report,\" \"manager approval,\" and related terms strongly suggest it falls under \"HR Support\" or potentially even \"Purchase,\" but I need to be precise. I'm carefully weighing those options against the available categories to make the best determination.\n\n\n**Re-evaluating the Options**\n\nI'm revisiting the categorization. Initially leaning towards \"HR Support\" or \"Purchase,\" the evidence is now pointing strongly towards \"Administrative rights.\" The phrases \"approval flow,\" \"routing slip,\" and \"manager approval\" all point to permissions or configuration issues within the expense reporting system. The user also mentions \"error occurred while displaying history\" which is possibly related to permissions. While \"HR Support\" has some relevance, it's not the primary concern.\n\n\n**Categorizing with Precision**\n\n\\n\\n\n\nI'm now completely settled on \"Administrative rights\" as the correct category for this ticket. The phrases \"approval flow\", \"routing slip\", and \"manager approval\", combined with the error messages and the user's desire for a \"multi-approval flow\", have solidified my analysis. It's clear the core issue revolves around system configuration and permissioning. This is not a purchase or HR matter, but a matter of administrative access and control within the expense reporting system.\n\n\n"
