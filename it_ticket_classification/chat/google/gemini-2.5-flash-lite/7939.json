The keywords \"account,\" \"locked,\" and \"unlock\" strongly indicate an access-related issue. My current thinking is leaning towards the \"Access\" category because of the direct mention of locked accounts.\n\n\n**Determining Best Fit Category**\n\nI've refined my initial assessment. The phrase \"AD locked\" strongly suggests the root issue lies with Active Directory, a core component of access management. While HR systems *could* be involved, the core problem is the inability to access a system. \"Access\" remains the most accurate categorization because the keywords explicitly describe the user's inability to log in. I'm confident \"Access\" is the right pick.\n\n\n**Refining Ticket Categorization**\n\nMy focus has shifted slightly. I've re-evaluated the context. The \"AD locked\" phrase is particularly telling. It confirms the issue's technical nature, not an HR process. I'm now even more certain that \"Access\" is the best fit, as the text describes a direct problem with logging in. While other categories might be tangentially relevant, none capture the core issue as directly as the ability to log into a system. My conclusion stands: \"Access\" is the most precise categorization.\n\n\n"
