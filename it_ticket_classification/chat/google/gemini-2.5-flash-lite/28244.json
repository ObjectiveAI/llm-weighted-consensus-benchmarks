The keywords are vague, but I'm leaning towards \"Access\" due to the mention of a \"module user\" and \"change.\" I'm reviewing the other options to ensure the best fit.\n\n\n**Focusing on User Access**\n\nI've honed in on the issue being an \"Access\" problem, which seems the most logical categorization. The provided text indicates trouble with user authentication within a specific module. Users are unable to connect or are being locked out, which directly relates to their access rights. While administrative rights might play a role, the core issue is the user's inability to use the module.\n\n\n**Clarifying User Permissions**\n\nI'm now fully convinced that the \"Access\" category is the best fit. While \"Administrative Rights\" could be relevant as a root cause, the core problem presented is user access and authentication within the module. The provided text details issues with a user's ability to connect and perform actions, strongly leaning towards access-related concerns. The authentication error is the primary symptom.\n\n\n"
