The terms \"costs approval flow,\" \"oracle,\" \"technology,\" \"incorrect approvers,\" and \"administrator\" are providing valuable clues. I'm focusing on the core issues to determine the best fit from the available categories, prioritizing a comprehensive and accurate categorization.\n\n\n**Pinpointing Key Issue**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the \"costs approval flow\" aspect of the ticket. The Oracle mention feels incidental, more a system detail than the root problem. \"Incorrect approvers\" and \"administrator\" point towards an access or workflow issue. I'm leaning towards \"Purchase\" as the dominant category, as the financial component of the approval flow feels central, but \"Access\" is also a strong contender. I'm carefully weighing both options.\n\n\n**Defining Categorization Focus**\n\nI'm solidifying my approach: prioritizing the \"costs approval flow\" term in the ticket. While \"Oracle\" and \"technology\" are present, they are less defining. \"Incorrect approvers\" and \"administrator\" are supportive, but secondary to the approval workflow. I am convinced that categorizing this as \"Purchase\" is the right choice, due to the central role the financial aspect plays.\n\n\n"
