Phrases like \"new starter access card\" and \"create credentials\" are leading me toward an \"Access\" or potentially \"HR Support\" designation. I'm leaning heavily toward \"Access\" but need more information to be certain. The mention of \"candidate\" is also something I must consider.\n\n\n**Categorizing Ticket: Access**\n\nBased on the ticket's text, I'm confident that \"Access\" is the right classification. The phrase \"create his credentials,\" along with \"new starter access card,\" clearly point toward needing system access. The additional note of \"candidate has accepted job offer\" further solidifies this direction. Considering the new starter's role as a \"developer\" also aligns neatly with needing access to the appropriate systems.\n\n\n"
