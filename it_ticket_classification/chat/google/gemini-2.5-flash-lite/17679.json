I'm leaning toward \"HR Support\" but need to confirm if access is the primary concern.\n\n\n**Pinpointing Primary Issue**\n\nI've thoroughly analyzed the ticket text, and the \"starter form\" and \"former employee\" phrasing really stood out. I'm now leaning heavily towards \"HR Support\" as the main category because the focus appears to be on the *process* of onboarding or offboarding, which typically encompasses things like access and hardware provisioning. The user's request for hardware seems secondary to the HR-initiated process. I still want to confirm that this is indeed the best fit.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Ticket Origins**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the ticket text and the available categories. It seems the key is deciphering the initial trigger of the request. \"New starter form,\" \"former employee,\" and \"starter form\" all hint at an HR-driven process. The hardware request feels secondary to the underlying onboarding/offboarding procedure. Although \"hardware\" is explicitly mentioned, the context points towards \"HR Support\" being the more accurate category since onboarding processes often encompass hardware requests.\n\n\n"
