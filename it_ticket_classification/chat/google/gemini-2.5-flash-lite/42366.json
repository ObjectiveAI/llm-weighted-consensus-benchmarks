After reviewing the content, I've concluded that the most fitting category is \"Access.\" The problem description points to a functionality issue with sharing rather than a complete inability to access the calendar itself.\n\n**Identifying Ticket Category**\n\nI've reviewed the IT ticket's content, focusing on the keywords \"shared calendar problem\" and \"issue with sharing calendar.\" After careful consideration of the available categories, I've determined that \"Access\" is the most appropriate classification. This decision is based on the ticket describing a problem with a collaborative functionality that likely involves permissions or configuration related to sharing resources.\n\n**Assigning Ticket Category**\n\nI'm focusing on categorizing the latest IT ticket concerning a shared calendar issue. After reviewing the provided text and available options, I've determined that \"Access\" is the most fitting classification for this problem.\n\n**Focusing on Categorization**\n\nI'm currently analyzing the IT ticket regarding the shared calendar issue. My primary objective is to assign it the most accurate category from the provided JSON schema, focusing on the core problem described to ensure proper routing.\n\n"
