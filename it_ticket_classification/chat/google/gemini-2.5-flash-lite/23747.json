I'm leaning toward \"HR Support\" but considering any overlapping keywords. I'll need to do a complete analysis, as the phrase on its own could relate to multiple options.\n\n\n**Prioritizing HR and Access**\n\nI'm now focusing on prioritizing between \"HR Support\" and \"Access\" as the most relevant categories for this ticket. The phrases \"new starter,\" \"interns accepted,\" and \"employment\" strongly suggest an HR-related task. However, the actions of changing and closing accounts definitely fall under the purview of access management. The overlap is clear, so I'm determining which is most primary.\n\n\n**Finalizing Category Selection**\n\nMy focus is now firmly on \"HR Support\" as the primary category, with \"Access\" a strong secondary consideration. The core request revolves around managing user accounts throughout their employment lifecycle, aligning directly with HR responsibilities. I've re-evaluated \"Access\" but ultimately determined the HR context (onboarding, employment status changes) is the driving force here. I feel confident that \"HR Support\" accurately reflects the primary action required, given the provided text.\n\n\n"
