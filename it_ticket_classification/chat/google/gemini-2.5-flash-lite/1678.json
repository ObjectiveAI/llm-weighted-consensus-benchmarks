The keywords \"leaver mobile\" and \"mobile subscription\" are key, but the context is still unclear. I'm leaning towards \"HR Support\" due to the leaver aspect, but need to confirm. The lack of specific technical details complicates things.\n\n\n**Revising Category Assignment**\n\nI've re-evaluated the \"HR Support\" categorization, still leaning that way given the \"leaver\" context and the need to potentially deactivate mobile services. While \"Access\" is relevant, \"HR Support\" appears more accurate, as it encompasses the broader offboarding process. I'm considering how deactivating the mobile subscription fits within the \"HR Support\" framework, perhaps as part of asset return/cancellation.\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket, and the \"HR Support\" categorization seems firm. The \"leaver\" context is definitive. The mobile phone and subscription are components of offboarding, confirming the HR connection. While there might be some overlap with access revocation, the ticket's focus is on the departure process, which aligns best with HR. The mailbox aspect reinforces this, as access management is a key part of the leaver procedure.\n\n\n"
