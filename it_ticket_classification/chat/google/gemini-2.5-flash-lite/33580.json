The term \"approver change\" suggests an access-related issue. However, I'm still weighing it against other possibilities, like an internal project related to access management.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've narrowed it down to \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" The phrase \"approver change\" is the crucial element. It suggests a modification of permissions or approval workflows. While an internal project is still possible, the ticket's brevity makes it less likely without further context.\n\n\n**Determining the Best Fit**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the ticket content, and the focus is clearly on modifications related to approvals. The term \"approver change\" is the critical identifier. After careful evaluation, I'm leaning toward \"Administrative rights.\" The request explicitly involves changes to who has approval authority, which is a core aspect of administrative control within a system or workflow. The alternative, \"Access,\" is broader and seems less precise in this context, as the ticket is not about general user access but the approval process itself.\n\n\n**Selecting the Best Category**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's content and the available categories. The request for an \"approver change\" is the crucial element. It clearly involves modifying an administrative function, and granting or revoking administrative control related to approval workflows. The phrase \"approver change\" indicates it's about control over an approval process or function. After a thorough analysis of all of the provided categories, the most precise fit for this scenario is undoubtedly \"Administrative Rights\".\n\n\n"
