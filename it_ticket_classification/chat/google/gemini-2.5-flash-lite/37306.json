My focus is on recognizing keywords like \"access,\" \"password,\" and \"locked out\" to solidify the classification.\n\n**Resolving Access Concerns**\n\nI've thoroughly analyzed the provided text, and the consistent emphasis on account login, password resets, and account status points overwhelmingly towards the \"Access\" category. The keywords and phrases strongly indicate that the core issue revolves around users being unable to get into their accounts.\n\n"
