My current approach involves keyword extraction to identify whether it pertains to hardware, access, or other specified categories for accurate assignment.\n\n**Resolving Device Issues**\n\nI've analyzed the IT ticket description, and the repeated emphasis on \"fix device\" and \"device details\" strongly indicates a hardware-related issue.
