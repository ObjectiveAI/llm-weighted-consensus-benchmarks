It centers on trouble accessing the \"change management area\" within ServiceNow. My initial assessment leans towards categorizing this as an \"Access\" issue, rather than \"Hardware.\" It's definitely not HR support or a miscellaneous matter. It's really all about the specific system.\n\n\n**Pinpointing Access Concerns**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the \"Access\" classification. While a hardware problem is conceivable, this really seems like a direct system access issue to me, specifically within \"ServiceNow's\" change management. I've ruled out HR, miscellaneous, and storage. It's an application access.\n\n\n"
