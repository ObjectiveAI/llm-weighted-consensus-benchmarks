After analyzing the keywords \"map upload,\" \"other locations needed,\" and \"re\", I've identified several potential categories. I'm leaning toward either \"Storage\" or \"Miscellaneous\" based on the initial assessment, but I'm still weighing the finer points to ensure the best fit.\n\n\n**Assessing Project Scope**\n\nI'm now considering the context of the IT ticket. After reviewing \"map upload,\" \"other locations needed,\" and \"infrastructure,\" I've excluded \"Storage\" and leaned towards \"Internal Project.\" The \"Infrastructure\" keyword strongly suggests this is about managing geographical data, possibly related to an internal mapping project. My aim is to accurately capture the project-oriented nature.\n\n\n**Revising Category Choice**\n\nAfter reviewing the ticket again, \"Internal Project\" still seems best, but \"Access\" is now in consideration as a secondary option. The map data may be sensitive or restricted, so access control could be part of the requirement. I'm focusing on whether map update relates to a wider project. I've ruled out \"Miscellaneous\" as I now have a solid candidate category.\n\n\n"
