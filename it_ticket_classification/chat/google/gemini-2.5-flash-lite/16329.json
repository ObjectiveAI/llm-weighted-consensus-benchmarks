The descriptions seem to revolve around display settings and system configuration, but I'm unsure if it leans towards hardware, access, or perhaps even a miscellaneous category related to system customization. I'm focusing on the terms \"wallpaper roll out\", \"screen resolutions\" and \"lock screen image\" to make a firm decision.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Rollout**\n\nI've decided \"Internal Project\" best describes the IT ticket. Deploying wallpaper and screen settings across workstations seems like a planned initiative rather than a hardware or access issue. While \"Miscellaneous\" was a possibility, \"Internal Project\" is more specific and accurately reflects the nature of the task, focusing on the broader scope of the planned changes.\n\n\n"
