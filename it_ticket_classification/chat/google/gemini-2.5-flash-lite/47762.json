                    "reasoning": "**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm currently trying to analyze the provided text to pinpoint the most accurate category. It seems related to a process or access issue for employees, but the details are somewhat vague. I'm considering \"Access\" or potentially \"Miscellaneous\" as the top contenders given the information.\n\n\n**Investigating Document Access**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the \"Access\" and \"Miscellaneous\" categories. The recurring theme is the inability of employees in Belgrade to upload or add documents, coupled with a technical hurdle.  I'm leaning towards \"Access\" due to the core problem of document upload limitations. However, the mention of \"sows process\" makes me consider \"Miscellaneous\" might also be applicable as it is vague.\n\n\n**Clarifying the Core Issue**\n\nI've been drilling down on this ticket. It's clearly about a technical problem hindering document uploading. While \"Access\" is a possibility, the recurring focus on a \"sows process\" and the ability to *add* documents points towards a broader workflow issue. The user is blocked due to technical issues, and the need for an ETA suggests a high-priority, system-related problem. I'm leaning towards \"Miscellaneous\" given the vague terminology or \"Access\" if it is limited permission to add documents.\n\n**Narrowing Down the Best Fit**\n\nI'm now focusing on whether the best category is \"Access\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" The user's focus on a \"sows process\" and technical difficulties when adding documents makes it broader than simple access control. I'm leaning toward \"Miscellaneous,\" though the issue could be stemming from an access issue and a permission issue, or a technical limitation. However, the recurring focus on a blocked workflow suggests it might be broader.\n\n**Identifying the Root Cause**\n\nI'm now determining whether the root cause is permission-based or a technical limitation. The \"HR Support\" category is looking increasingly relevant, as the issue hinders an employee's ability to perform a task within an HR-related system. This could be due to permission problems or a broader technical glitch in the workflow. \"Access\" is still a contender if it's a matter of missing permissions, but the \"solve technical issue\" phrasing suggests a wider problem.\n\n\n**Identifying the Appropriate Support**\n\nThe core issue seems to be a technical hurdle blocking document uploads for employees in Belgrade. The term \"sows process\" keeps popping up, hinting at its importance. I've narrowed it down to whether the issue is HR-related or a broader technical problem. It's difficult to tell because \"HR Support\" could be a cause of this issue, as well as access issues, as the \"technical issues\" could mean the employees don't have the appropriate access.\n\n**Prioritizing HR-Related IT Issues**\n\nI'm now focusing on classifying this IT ticket. After analyzing the wording, the phrase \"add their contracts\" seems very HR-related, along with the \"sows process.\" I'm now leaning heavily toward \"HR Support\" because the ticket's core issue, the technical inability to upload documents, seems to be impacting employees' ability to complete HR-related tasks.\n\n\n**Identifying HR-Related IT Issues**\n\nI've determined that the core issue revolves around employees' inability to add documents, specifically contracts, which falls squarely within the HR domain. The technical block is the problem, but it's fundamentally an issue hindering HR-related tasks. I'm choosing \"HR Support\" because the root is in HR.\n\n\n"
