I'm leaning toward \"HR Support\" or \"Access\" as possible categories. I'm cross-referencing these against the provided list to find the best fit, while considering a possibility of \"Miscellaneous\" for a very vague request.\n\n\n**Categorizing the New Ticket**\n\nI've been analyzing the ticket text \"new starter pm hello please fill.\" My thought process has narrowed the potential categories. I've ruled out \"Hardware,\" \"Storage,\" and \"Purchase\" as they don't align with the text. I'm leaning heavily towards \"HR Support\" due to the nature of a new employee needing onboarding. \"Access\" is still a possibility, but HR usually handles that initiation. The request isn't specific enough for \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights.\" \"Miscellaneous\" seems too broad given other options.\n\n\n**Determining Best Fit**\n\nMy analysis of the ticket \"new starter pm hello please fill\" has concluded that \"HR Support\" is the most fitting category. I've considered all other options like \"Access\" or even \"Miscellaneous\", but \"HR Support\" clearly aligns best with the onboarding nature of the request.\n\n\n"
