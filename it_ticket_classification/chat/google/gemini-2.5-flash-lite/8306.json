However, I'm still considering potential alternative categories, ensuring that the chosen category truly reflects the core of the issue.\n\n\n**Evaluating HR Support Alignment**\n\nI'm now considering the \"HR Support\" category as a very good match for the IT ticket content. I am convinced it might be the right fit because the text focuses on user lifecycles (starters and leavers), which clearly align with the HR domain. The ticket appears to involve coordinating license assignments with HR processes like onboarding and offboarding. I am now leaning towards this classification, while checking other candidates to compare my assumptions.\n\n\n**Confirming HR Integration**\n\nI'm now fully convinced that \"HR Support\" is the right category. The consistent emphasis on \"starters\" and \"leavers\" reinforces the strong tie to HR-related processes like onboarding and offboarding. License management is a fundamental part of the employee lifecycle, directly linking IT operations with HR functions. The recent analysis of the expanded text further solidified this conclusion, solidifying my final selection.\n\n\n"
