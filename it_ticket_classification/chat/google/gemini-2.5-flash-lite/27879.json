My initial analysis of the text suggests a potential \"Access\" category due to keywords like \"password.\" I'm cross-referencing this with the available enum options to ensure the most precise classification.\n\n**Identifying Ticket Category**\n\nI'm actively analyzing the ticket's content, focusing on keywords like \"password reset\" and \"locked out.\" My current assessment strongly suggests the \"Access\" category, as these terms directly pertain to user authentication and account management. I'm refining this classification against the provided enum.\n\n**Selecting Ticket Category**\n\nI've thoroughly reviewed the ticket's content, noting keywords like \"password reset\" and \"locked out.\" Based on this, I've concluded that \"Access\" is the most appropriate classification, directly addressing user authentication and account management issues.\n\n"
