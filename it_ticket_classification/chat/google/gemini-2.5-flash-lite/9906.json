I'm focusing on keywords and context. \"New starter\" and \"interns\" suggest HR or Access-related issues, but it's very brief. I am leaning toward HR support.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Access Request**\n\nI've refined my analysis and am now strongly leaning towards \"Access\" as the appropriate category. The term \"new starter,\" combined with \"interns,\" clearly points toward the need for account creation, system access, and possibly email setup. While \"Hardware\" or \"HR Support\" are possibilities, the direct request for \"fill\" implies completing an onboarding process that's fundamentally about access. Therefore, I believe \"Access\" best reflects the core of this IT ticket.\n\n\n**Assigning Ticket Priority**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket to gauge priority. Although the text is brief, the presence of \"new starter\" and \"interns\" suggests an immediate need. Delays in access provisioning can hinder their onboarding. While the ticket doesn't indicate critical urgency, I'm leaning towards assigning it a \"medium\" priority. This ensures timely processing without unnecessarily escalating it. My rationale is the potential impact on new employees' ability to start work.\n\n\n"
