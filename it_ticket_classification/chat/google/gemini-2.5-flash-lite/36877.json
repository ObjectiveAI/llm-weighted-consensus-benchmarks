After a thorough review, I've determined that \"HR Support\" is the most accurate classification. While access is a component, the primary concern revolves around accessing and updating salary history data, which falls squarely within the scope of HR-related support. This decision was made after carefully considering alternative categories and eliminating those that didn't align with the core issue.\n\n\n"
