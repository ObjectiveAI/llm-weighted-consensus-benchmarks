The keywords are proving difficult, as the text is sparse. I will need to consider all the options.\n\n\n**Focusing On Category Assignment**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and the potential categories. The \"backup tapes\" phrase keeps standing out. I'm leaning heavily toward \"Storage\" as the primary category, despite some of the surrounding text being ambiguous. I need to make sure this is the most accurate reflection of the service being requested. The other phrases seem to be less relevant, such as the references to scheduled times and queues.\n\n\n**Reiterating Key Points**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket text, zeroing in on the \"backup tapes\" phrasing. The other components are less relevant to the core request. \"Storage\" feels like the most accurate category, based on the concrete IT task of handling backups. I'm focusing on the primary function being requested and the category that makes the most sense. I'm satisfied that \"Storage\" best encapsulates the user's intent.\n\n\n"
