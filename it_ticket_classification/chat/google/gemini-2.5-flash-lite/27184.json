The key terms \"edit rights\" suggest an access issue, but the remaining words are unclear. I'm focusing on identifying any specific keywords or phrases that might definitively point to \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" or other categories. The lack of clear context makes this more challenging, requiring careful interpretation.\n\n\n**Determining Category Match**\n\nI've honed in on the key phrases within the ticket and am leaning heavily towards \"Access.\" The references to \"edit rights,\" \"greyed-out cells,\" and the user's need to \"update forecasts\" strongly suggest a permissions issue. I've eliminated \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and others, leaving \"Access\" as the most appropriate fit within the provided categories. It's a clear case of needing specific permissions to perform certain actions.\n\n\n**Narrowing Category Scope**\n\nI'm now fully committed to the \"Access\" category. The text highlights a lack of permissions affecting the user's ability to update specific items.  Phrases like \"edit rights,\" \"update forecasts,\" and \"greyed-out cells\" all strongly signal access restrictions. While \"Administrative rights\" is relevant, the core issue is the *inability* to perform actions due to missing permissions, firmly placing this ticket in the \"Access\" domain.\n\n\n"
