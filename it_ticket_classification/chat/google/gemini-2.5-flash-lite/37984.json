My focus is now on confirming whether it's solely about access, or if other categories might be relevant too, but so far I am sure.\n\n\n**Narrowing the Focus**\n\nIt looks like \"Access\" is the main category, as the phrases point to it consistently. I'm double-checking to ensure no other categories are necessary, but the language used strongly leans towards an access-related issue.\n\n\n"
