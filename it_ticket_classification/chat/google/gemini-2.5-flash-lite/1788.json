Given the text focuses on \"resolved reports\" and \"notifications\" with a \"resolution date,\" it doesn't neatly fit into specific technical categories like Hardware or Access. I'm leaning towards \"Miscellaneous\" as the most appropriate classification for this reporting anomaly.\n\n**Classifying Ticket Details**\n\nI'm currently assessing the provided IT ticket text. My current analysis leads me to believe that \"Miscellaneous\" is the most fitting category, as the ticket concerns issues with old notifications and resolved reports without directly aligning with Hardware, HR, Access, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, or Administrative rights.\n\n"
