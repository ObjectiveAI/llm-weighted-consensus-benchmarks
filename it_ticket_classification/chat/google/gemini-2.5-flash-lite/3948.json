My aim is to accurately map the user's request to one of the predefined options such as Hardware, HR Support, Access, or others.\n\n**Classifying Software Upgrade**\n\nI'm currently classifying an IT ticket. The description heavily features \"upgrade\" actions for internal applications like \"Black Duck\" and \"Hub,\" including mentions of licensing and new features. Given these specifics, I'm leaning towards \"Internal Project\" as the most fitting category.\n\n**Selecting Category**\n\nI'm confirming the classification for the IT ticket. Based on the emphasis on \"upgrade,\" \"licensing,\" and features for internal tools like \"Black Duck\" and \"Hub,\" I've selected \"Internal Project\" as the most appropriate category.\n\n"
