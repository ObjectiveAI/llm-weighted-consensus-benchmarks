I'm carefully comparing the ticket content against the predefined categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. I want to ensure the classification is precise and reflects the essence of the issue.\n\n\n**Defining the Ticket's Focus**\n\nI'm now focusing on the core issue highlighted in the ticket. It's becoming clear that the main concern revolves around Confluence access. I'm seeing several issues related to password resets, expired credentials, and getting access to the application. I am trying to figure out if it is an access, password, or account issue.\n\n\n**Confirming Access Classification**\n\nI've analyzed the ticket content and determined the central theme. The text indicates multiple issues stemming from Confluence access, including password resets, expired credentials, and user account lockouts. This confirms the \"Access\" category as the most appropriate classification.\n\n\n"
