It's becoming clearer that this isn't a hardware or HR issue. Currently, I'm leaning toward an access-related categorization. The next step is a more detailed analysis to confirm this classification before offering a recommendation.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Issue**\n\nIt's clear that the user is experiencing data loading problems post-reinstall. While initially leaning towards \"Access,\" the lack of specific permission-related details makes that less likely. \"Miscellaneous\" appears a more accurate fit, given the general nature of the system malfunction. I need to gather more info before making a definitive classification. The problem seems to be linked to the software, and the user needs guidance.\n\n\n**Clarifying the Root Cause**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the best category for this ticket. The user reports data isn't loading, even after reinstalling the software. Initially, 'Access' seemed plausible, but now I'm leaning away from it. The user needs help, but the issue is vague. After review, it appears 'Miscellaneous' is the strongest fit. Data loading failures don't seem like the core problem. The general system failure better aligns with this label.\n\n\n"
