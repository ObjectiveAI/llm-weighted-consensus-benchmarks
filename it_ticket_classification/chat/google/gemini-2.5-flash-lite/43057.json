Other members can access, so it is an access restriction. Given the lack of specific hardware or project details, I'm leaning toward selecting \"Access\" as the most suitable category. I need to make sure this meets the user's needs.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've been analyzing the ticket text and it keeps pointing to \"Access\". The phrase \"cannot access\" pops up repeatedly, and the comparison to other users confirms it's a specific access restriction. My evaluation of the available categories (\"Hardware\", \"HR Support\", etc.) reinforces that \"Access\" is the most direct fit. It's a clear statement of inability to reach something, and others have no issue reaching it. I believe this categorization fulfills the purpose of the ticket.\n\n\n"
