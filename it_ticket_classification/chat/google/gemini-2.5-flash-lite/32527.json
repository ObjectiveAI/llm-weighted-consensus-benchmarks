It seems the repeated \"cards usage\" points toward access-related issues. The phrase \"internal audit\" further reinforces this. I am leaning towards the \"Access\" category, and will move forward with that assumption, unless new information appears, leading me in another direction.\n\n\n**Identifying Key Themes**\n\nI've zeroed in on the \"cards usage\" and \"access\" themes, repeatedly. The ticket is littered with instances of employees using cards and needing to \"find\" information about those usages. This strongly suggests an access control issue, rather than HR support or hardware. I'm focusing my analysis on this aspect.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Access Issue**\n\nMy analysis indicates that the ticket clearly revolves around access card management. Keywords like \"cards usage,\" \"disabled cards,\" and \"intern left key holder\" are prominent. The repeated need to \"find out\" about card usage strongly suggests an access control issue, which excludes HR, storage, and purchase. While some elements touch on administrative tasks, the core focus is managing access. Therefore, I'm confident categorizing this as an \"Access\" issue.\n\n\n"
