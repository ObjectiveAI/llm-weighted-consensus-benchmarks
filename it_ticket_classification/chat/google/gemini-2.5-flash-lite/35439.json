                    "reasoning": "**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm currently trying to map this IT ticket to the correct category. The content is about an Oracle error, so I'm leaning toward \"Access\" or \"Miscellaneous,\" but need more context. I'm carefully reviewing the phrasing to see if there are any subtle clues pointing to a specific access issue versus a general system problem. The lack of specific details makes this a challenging classification.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Options**\n\nI've been analyzing the phrasing within the IT ticket. I believe it is about adding some kind of \"generic for code,\" which is pointing me to either \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project\". I am now focusing on determining whether the \"generic for code\" is a part of an established internal project.\n\n\n**Finalizing Category Selection**\n\nI'm now leaning toward \"Miscellaneous,\" but \"Access\" is still a contender. The Oracle error is a specific software problem, and the \"add generic for code\" action suggests a potential permission or configuration issue. Without clearer context, I'm finding it difficult to definitively assign this to \"Internal Project.\" For now, I'll go with \"Miscellaneous,\" assuming this is a generic software problem.\n\n\n**Revisiting Category Choices**\n\nI'm now focusing on 'Access' and 'Administrative rights.' It seems the core issue revolves around a permission or configuration problem, highlighted by the \"oracle error\" when attempting to \"add generic for code\". I'm reconsidering that the user might lack necessary privileges, thus resulting in the reported error. This seems like a promising direction to find a more precise category.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Oracle Error**\n\nI am now focusing on determining whether \"add generic for code\" indicates a required level of access, or if the \"Oracle error\" stems from insufficient administrative privileges. \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" are both strong contenders because of the action taken and the error encountered, but I will continue my analysis to make the best choice.\n\n\n**Re-evaluating the Best Category**\n\nI am now focusing on either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" The core of the issue is an \"oracle error\" encountered while attempting to \"add generic for code\". I am trying to determine if this action specifically requires administrative privileges, or if the underlying issue is related to restricted access levels. The phrase \"add generic for code\" implies an action with system-level implications, suggesting elevated permissions are likely needed.\n\n\n**Finalizing the Classification**\n\nI'm now prioritizing either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" The \"oracle error\" paired with the attempt to \"add generic for code\" suggests a potential permissions issue. Given the ambiguous nature of \"add generic for code,\" I'm focused on whether this action implies the need for system-level access.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Root Cause**\n\nI'm now focusing on \"Administrative rights.\" The Oracle error, combined with the action of trying to \"add generic for code,\" suggests the user might lack necessary privileges. This is the most probable cause for the reported error.\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nI'm now focusing on a possible 'Access' or 'Administrative Rights' issue tied to an Oracle error while attempting to 'add generic for code'.  This phrase strongly suggests a permissions-related problem, making those two categories most relevant. However, the exact nature of \"generic for code\" remains unclear.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Oracle Error**\n\nI am currently focusing on whether the root cause lies in \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" The \"oracle error\" linked to \"add generic for code\" strongly suggests a permissions-based problem. I am considering if the user lacks the necessary privilege to perform this operation. The vagueness of \"add generic for code\" is my current obstacle to pinpointing the best category.\n\n\n**Refining Category Determination**\n\nI'm now prioritizing either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" The \"oracle error\" linked to \"add generic for code\" suggests it's a permission issue. The user is attempting a privileged action, and the specific error indicates a potential rights restriction. I am now leaning towards this direction.\n\n\n**Refining Category Determination**\n\nI'm focusing now on 'Administrative rights' or 'Access'. The \"oracle error\" while trying to \"add generic for code\" points to a potential permissions issue. Given the action and the error, I'm analyzing whether the user requires administrative rights to add this \"generic\" element or if it's a lack of access to a resource. I'll stick with one of these.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Ticket Classification**\n\nI'm now refining the category between \"Access\" and \"Administrative Rights\". The Oracle error encountered while trying to \"add generic for code\" points to a potential permissions-related issue, suggesting a need for elevated privileges. This is a crucial step towards the final classification.\n\n\n**Reassessing the Categorization**\n\nI'm now focusing on a possible issue with \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" The \"oracle error\" during an attempt to \"add generic for code\" suggests a permission problem. I'm exploring if the user lacks the necessary privilege to add this configuration or is prevented from adding generic access.\n\n\n**Refining Ticket Categorization**\n\nI've been analyzing the nature of the \"Oracle error\" combined with the attempted \"add generic for code\". I am focusing on permissions. I am deciding whether the root cause lies within \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" The ambiguity in the phrase \"add generic for code\" still requires careful consideration for selecting the best category.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Category Determination**\n\nI'm now focusing on 'Access' or 'Administrative rights.' The \"oracle error\" during the attempt to \"add generic for code\" points to a potential permissions problem. It seems the user lacks the necessary privilege to add this configuration or is prevented from adding generic access.\n\n\n**Evaluating the Oracle Error**\n\nI'm now prioritizing either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" The \"oracle error\" linked to \"add generic for code\" suggests a potential permissions issue. Given the action and the error, I'm analyzing whether the user requires administrative rights to add this \"generic\" element or if it's a lack of access to a resource. I'll stick with one of these.\n\n\n**Classifying Oracle-Related Errors**\n\nI'm leaning toward 'Access' as the most relevant category. The Oracle error strongly suggests a permissions or configuration problem, even though the specific action \"add generic for code\" is vague. The user is clearly unable to perform a requested action, thus access is blocked.\n\n\n**Refining Ticket Categorization**\n\nI've been analyzing the nature of the \"Oracle error\" combined with the attempted \"add generic for code\".
