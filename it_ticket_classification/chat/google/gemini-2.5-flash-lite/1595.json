My aim is to refine my approach to accurately categorize these types of IT requests. I'm exploring how these phrases, and the contexts they appear in, will help with automatic categorization. Currently, I'm thinking of focusing more on the specific verbs within the text.\n\n\n**Identifying the Best Fit**\n\nI've determined that \"Internal Project\" best describes the essence of the ticket's content. The language used in the phrases, such as \"testing to analysis,\" \"discipline,\" and \"architecture,\" points toward an ongoing project involving transitioning between stages. These factors exclude the other categories as they don't capture this focus.\n\n\n"
