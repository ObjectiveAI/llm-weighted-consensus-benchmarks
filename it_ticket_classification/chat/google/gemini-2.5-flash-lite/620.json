I'm leaning toward \"Internal Project\" as the most suitable category, but still comparing it with other potential fits.\n\n\n**Revising Category Choices**\n\nI've refined my initial assessment. While \"Internal Project\" still seems strong, I'm now also considering \"Miscellaneous.\" The expense report change involves system configuration to track project costs. This doesn't neatly fall into a specific area like HR or Access. But the request *is* a project for the internal system. The user wants to improve the process so the ticket *could* be put into miscellaneous or internal project.\n\n\n**Refining Categorization Focus**\n\nThe \"Internal Project\" categorization resonates strongly.  However, I'm now exploring if \"Miscellaneous\" might better capture the system configuration aspect. The expense report change aims at bolstering cost tracking, indirectly supporting internal projects. \"Miscellaneous\" might also be a good fit, but I'm trying to decide if the project tracking component outweighs the \"miscellaneous\" nature. I'm focusing on \"Internal Project\" and \"Miscellaneous\" and how they fit the scope.\n\n\n**Deciding on Final Classification**\n\nCurrently, I'm leaning heavily towards \"Internal Project.\" The system configuration aspect is indeed significant, but it *directly* serves the purpose of improving financial tracking *for* internal projects. The request is essentially a process enhancement to ensure accurate cost allocation related to projects. Although \"Miscellaneous\" is a backup, the \"Internal Project\" category captures the essence of the request more directly, especially considering the goal is better project cost management.\n\n\n**Concluding on Classification Choice**\n\nI've carefully considered \"Miscellaneous\" and \"Internal Project.\" The system configuration aspect is relevant, but the core issue is enhancing project cost management via mandatory expense reporting, making \"Internal Project\" the better fit. The urgency mentioned indicates a significant impact, making the cost tracking aspect crucial for project control. The mandatory \"project number\" aligns directly with the \"Internal Project\" category, solidifying my decision.\n\n\n"
