Keywords like \"requisition rejected\" appear frequently. I'm actively working to determine if \"Purchase\" is the most fitting category, or if there might be a more specific or accurate choice from the provided list, such as \"Internal Project\" or something else. My aim is to select the most precise classification.\n\n\n**Analyzing Relevant Categories**\n\nI've determined \"Purchase\" is the most fitting classification based on the ticket text. The repeated keywords related to requisitioning, amounts, suppliers, and rejections solidify this. While other options were considered, they didn't align with the core issue of a rejected procurement request. This selection emphasizes my focus on precision in categorization.\n\n\n**Validating Category Choice**\n\nI'm now fully confident that \"Purchase\" is the right category. The repeated use of \"requisition\" and related vocabulary, like supplier, amount, and rejection, leaves no doubt this is a procurement issue. I've thoroughly considered and dismissed other categories, as they lack the precise connection to the core problem of a rejected purchase request. My refined focus is to ensure precise classification in this scenario.\n\n\n"
