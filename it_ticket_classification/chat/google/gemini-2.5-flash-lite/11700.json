Initial analysis of keywords like \"leaver,\" \"mailbox,\" \"roaming profile,\" and \"AD rights\" suggests it's related to access management. I'm focusing on \"Access\" as the most appropriate category for this specific issue related to an employee leaving the company.\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nI've re-examined the keywords and solidified my belief that \"Access\" is the most fitting category. While \"HR Support\" has a slight connection due to the leaver process, the core of the issue involves managing user access rights, deactivating accounts, and handling mailboxes after termination. The focus on \"AD,\" \"mailbox,\" and \"roaming profile\" directly supports this choice.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Access Management**\n\nI've examined the keywords again, particularly \"leaver,\" \"ad rights,\" and \"mailbox,\" and they all definitively point to \"Access.\" I'm prioritizing access management based on the employee's departure. The ticket focuses on deactivating and adjusting user accounts and related services, firmly solidifying my categorization choice.\n\n\n"
