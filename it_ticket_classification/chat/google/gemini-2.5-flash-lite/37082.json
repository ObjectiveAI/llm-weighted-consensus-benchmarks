I've received some text data that I'm now analyzing to help with category selection. I'm carefully considering the list of options to ensure the most accurate classification.\n\n\n**Identifying the Root Cause**\n\nI've zeroed in on the text data and identified the central issue as related to storage and disk space management after a Windows upgrade. The user's query about file removal and size concerns clearly point to \"Storage\" as the most relevant category. I've ruled out other categories like Hardware or Access, focusing on the practical implications of the upgrade and its impact on available storage.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Category Selection**\n\nI've just refined my choice to \"Storage.\"  The ticket text, particularly phrases like \"file sizes\" and \"space occupied\" post-\"Windows upgrade,\" leaves little doubt. While other categories were considered, the user's focus on managing disk space after the upgrade solidifies \"Storage\" as the best fit. I'm now ready to classify this ticket.\n\n\n"
