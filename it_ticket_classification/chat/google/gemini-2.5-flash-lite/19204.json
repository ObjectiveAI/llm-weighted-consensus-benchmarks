My task is to analyze the unstructured text and assign it to one of the predefined categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, or Administrative rights.\n\n**Assigning Ticket Category**\n\nI'm analyzing the IT ticket's text, which primarily details mobile phone specifications like display, processor, camera, and battery. This strongly suggests the \"Hardware\" category. I'm confirming if any other elements push it towards a different classification.\n\n**Refining Ticket Categorization**\n\nI've thoroughly analyzed the IT ticket's text, which predominantly contains detailed specifications and features of a mobile phone. Keywords like \"display,\" \"processor,\" \"camera,\" and \"battery\" unequivocally point towards the \"Hardware\" category. I'm now double-checking if any secondary elements might necessitate reclassification.\n\n**Finalizing Category Selection**\n\nI've thoroughly reviewed the provided text, and the overwhelming presence of terms like \"display,\" \"processor,\" \"camera,\" and \"battery\" definitively places this IT ticket under the \"Hardware\" category. I've considered other possibilities but found no compelling reasons to deviate.\n\n"
