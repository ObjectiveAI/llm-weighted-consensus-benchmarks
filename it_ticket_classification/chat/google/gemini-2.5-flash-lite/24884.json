My current assessment strongly suggests \"Access\" as the primary classification, given the recurring theme of \"access cards\" and their usage, ordering, and control across different locations and teams.\n\n**Identifying Ticket Category**\n\nI've been focused on distilling the essence of the IT ticket. My current progress leans heavily towards categorizing it under \"Access,\" given the repeated references to \"access cards,\" their ordering, usage, and control across various teams and locations.\n\n"
