Initial assessment points toward either \"HR Support\" or potentially \"Access\" due to the \"new starter\" phrase. I'm focusing on keywords and common phrases typically associated with each category for a more precise classification. A more refined analysis is underway.\n\n\n**Categorizing the New Ticket**\n\nI've been examining the ticket content \"new starter hi please fill thank kind regards\". My priority is to pinpoint the most accurate category from \"Hardware|HR Support|Access|Miscellaneous|Storage|Purchase|Internal Project|Administrative rights\". Initially, \"HR Support\" appears the strongest fit because \"new starter\" commonly links with HR onboarding. However, I'm now also closely evaluating \"Access\" as a direct and possibly more specific aspect of onboarding. \"Miscellaneous\" is a backup but not preferred.\n\n\n**Finalizing Category Selection**\n\nI'm now fully committed to \"HR Support\" as the definitive category for this \"new starter\" ticket. Although access provisioning is a key element, the broader scope of HR Support encompasses the complete initial onboarding process, which aligns best with the ticket's overall context. My analysis highlights \"new starter\" as the dominant keyword, and I've ruled out the less relevant options after a thorough evaluation.\n\n\n"
