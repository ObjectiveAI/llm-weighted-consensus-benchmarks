Currently, I'm focusing on keywords like \"display,\" \"black screen,\" and \"cursor\" to determine the most relevant category.  I'm leaning towards \"Hardware,\" as the issue seems related to physical equipment. I will now process the other options and continue to refine my analysis.\n\n\n**Finalizing Categorization Assessment**\n\nMy analysis is complete. I've re-evaluated the ticket description, focusing on key phrases and symptoms. It's now unequivocally a \"Hardware\" issue, primarily concerning a display exhibiting erratic behavior. The workaround strongly indicates a physical connection or driver issue, solidifying this category choice. I'm ready to finalize my assessment and provide the single \"category\" key-value pair.\n\n\n**Reaching a Conclusion**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's description, focusing on the display's behavior and the suggested workaround. The keywords and phrases point directly to a \"Hardware\" issue. The black screen and connection mention solidify this. While I considered other options, \"Hardware\" is the most precise and relevant category based on my analysis. Therefore, I'm ready to finalize the JSON output.\n\n\n"
