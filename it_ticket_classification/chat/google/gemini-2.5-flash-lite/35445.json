My focus is on extracting the core issue from the text and then connecting it with one of the predefined categories, such as \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" or \"Access.\" The goal is to perform this initial mapping step and ensure accuracy.\n\n\n**Mapping the Ticket's Core**\n\nI'm now focusing on the ticket's keywords to deduce its nature. \"Approve requisition\" and \"pending tasks\" are crucial. This user can't approve their requisition because of pending tasks. Hardware, HR Support, Access, and Storage are not relevant. This aligns best with \"Purchase,\" given the requisition's purchasing nature.\n\n\n**Identifying Ticket Category**\n\nI've analyzed the ticket's description, focusing on key phrases like \"cannot approve requisition\" and \"pending tasks\".  My conclusion is it best fits the category \"Purchase\". I've ruled out \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights\" as they don't capture the essence of a requisition approval issue.\n\n\n"
