The details consistently point towards the need for appropriate access rights and credentials.\n\n**Refining Ticket Classification**\n\nI'm currently confirming the primary classification as \"Access\" because the repeated emphasis on permissions, user authentication, and the requirements for app deployment environments strongly aligns with this category. The queries around certificates also point to securing and managing access.\n\n"
