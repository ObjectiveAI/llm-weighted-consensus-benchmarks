The phrasing \"arranging leave\" is a prominent element, and I'm considering whether it falls under \"HR Support\" or \"Access\", as it relates to user permissions or leave management systems. I'm also considering the potential for this to be a miscellaneous inquiry.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Ticket**\n\nI've honed in on the key phrase \"arranging leave,\" which repeatedly surfaces, reinforcing my initial instinct. The context strongly aligns with HR functions rather than hardware, storage or purchase-related issues. I've ruled out the other categories like Access or Administrative rights since leave-related inquiries don't typically involve those aspects.  My conclusion is \"HR Support\".\n\n\n"
