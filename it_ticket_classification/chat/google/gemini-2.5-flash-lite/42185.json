I'm leaning toward selecting \"Access\" as the most appropriate category, since it seems to be the most accurate fit based on the request.\n\n\n**Reiterating the Category**\n\nI've examined the ticket text again, focusing on the keywords. \"Deactivate,\" \"visitor card,\" and \"visitor manager\" all point directly to access control. No other category, such as Hardware, HR Support, or Miscellaneous, seems to fit as well. I'm now certain that \"Access\" is the most accurate classification.\n\n\n"
