The key phrases seem to hint at a new employee setup, which suggests \"HR Support\" or \"Access\" as likely possibilities. I'm focusing on the context to differentiate between them.\n\n\n**Deciding on the Best Fit**\n\nI'm now focusing on the nuance between \"HR Support\" and \"Access.\" While \"new starter\" points toward HR, the need for \"further assistance\" could imply access issues. I'm leaning towards \"HR Support\" as the initial classification, but I'll add a note about possible access-related subtasks. The wording of the ticket is sparse, which makes a definitive choice tricky. Further context would be ideal!\n\n\n**Choosing HR Support**\n\nI've considered all the categories, and decided \"HR Support\" is the most appropriate. The term \"new starter\" points strongly toward onboarding, which is the main focus here. Although access provisioning is likely part of the onboarding process, \"HR Support\" covers the broader context. I've noted that \"Access\" might be relevant as a subtask if the ticket requires account setup.\n\n\n"
