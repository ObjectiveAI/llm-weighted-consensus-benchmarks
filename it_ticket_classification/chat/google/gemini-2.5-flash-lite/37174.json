I'm leaning toward HR Support, but need to consider other categories. I'm now looking for any other clues about the issue.\n\n\n**Pinpointing HR Relevance**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the ticket text for clues. \"Timecards\" and \"submit for approval\" are consistently appearing, strengthening the connection to HR Support. The errors described point to system-related issues within the time tracking process, aligning with HR functions. Considering the alternative categories, this is clearly the best fit. I'm now certain this issue should be categorized under HR Support.\n\n\n**Defining the Core Issue**\n\nI've closely analyzed the ticket text, repeatedly seeing \"timecards\" and \"submit for approval,\" definitively pointing to an HR-related system. Errors in this process, rejections, and status problems within the timecard system further solidify the HR Support category. The issue isn't access *to* the system, but the user's difficulties within it.\n\n\n"
