Analyzing the text, \"new starter,\" it seems the core issue revolves around onboarding or access provisioning. I'm carefully considering how best to capture this nuance within the available options, leaning toward \"Access\" or potentially \"HR Support.\"\n\n\n**Evaluating Category Fit**\n\nI've been meticulously examining the ticket content in light of the available categories. \"HR Support\" appears to be the most fitting choice, as the new employee's onboarding process is directly connected with the key phrases, \"new starter,\" \"joining,\" and related administrative tasks. Though, administrative rights or access might be needed later, \"HR Support\" is the primary driver based on the text.\n\n\n**Finalizing Ticket Assignment**\n\nI'm now fully confident that \"HR Support\" is the most accurate category for this ticket. After considering \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights\", I've concluded that the primary issue revolves around the onboarding process, including completing forms and administrative tasks associated with a \"new starter\". This is firmly within the scope of HR, making it the most appropriate choice.\n\n\n"
