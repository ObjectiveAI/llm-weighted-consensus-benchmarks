It aligns well with the process-oriented nature of the ticket's description.\n\n**Categorizing Expense Flow**\n\nI'm actively categorizing the IT ticket. Given the strong indicators like \"expense approval flow,\" \"amend,\" \"approvers,\" and \"per diem cost,\" I'm confident \"HR Support\" is the most appropriate classification, as it best encapsulates employee-related financial processes and workflows among the available options.\n\n**Finalizing Expense Category**\n\nI've thoroughly reviewed the ticket's keywords, and I'm confirming \"HR Support\" as the most precise classification. This category best encompasses the employee-centric financial workflows and approval processes described, aligning with the operational needs of HR and finance functions.\n\n"
