My objective is to ensure accurate classification.\n\n**Classifying IT Requests**\n\nI'm currently processing the IT ticket text, focusing on identifying keywords that directly relate to hardware procurement and installation, such as \"switch installation\" and specific equipment like \"patch panel\" and \"adaptor.\" The recurring \"po\" also strongly suggests a purchase, reinforcing the hardware classification.\n\n**Identifying Hardware Components**\n\nI'm focusing on the specific terms within the ticket, like \"patch panel\" and \"adaptor,\" which clearly signal hardware. This, combined with \"switch installation\" and the repeated \"po,\" strongly reinforces the hardware classification.\n\n"
