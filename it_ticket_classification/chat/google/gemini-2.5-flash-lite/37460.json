I'm leaning toward a category that reflects document sharing or access-related issues.\n\n\n**Refining Access Category**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on \"Access\" as the most suitable category. The ticket describes document link expirations, directly impacting access duration and usability.  I've reviewed the supporting details regarding project workflow disruption, and am reaffirming this choice, although some overlap with other categories exists. This ensures the issue is routed appropriately, aligning with the IT process.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Access Control**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the ticket content, and the focus is clearly on the time-bound access to shared documents. I'm focusing specifically on the expiration policy. I've ruled out Hardware, HR, Purchase, and Storage.  I'm debating between Administrative Rights and Access, since both seem relevant, but now I'm leaning heavily towards \"Access.\" My rationale is that it describes the limitation imposed, not necessarily a lack of rights per se.\n\n\n**Confirming Access Focus**\n\nI'm solidifying my rationale for selecting \"Access.\" The core issue is the **limitation on the duration of shared document links**, directly impacting how users access information. My focus is now on confirming that the problem is not about the lack of specific rights but rather about the imposed access controls. I've re-reviewed the ticket text with this in mind. The focus is to allow more time, which is controlled via access permissions.\n\n\n"
