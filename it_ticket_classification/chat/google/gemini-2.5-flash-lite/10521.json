The presence of \"per diem,\" \"expense report,\" and \"cost center\" strongly suggests a financial or administrative nature. I'm leaning toward categorizing this as \"Administrative rights,\" but want to be sure it doesn't fit better into \"HR Support\" first. I need to make the right choice between these options.\n\n\n**Confirming HR Relevance**\n\nI've refined my thinking, prioritizing \"HR Support\" as the primary category for this ticket. The \"per diem\" and \"expense report\" mentions solidify this decision. While \"Administrative Rights\" remains a consideration, the explicit HR and finance links make \"HR Support\" the clear frontrunner, and it is most likely that this is the best fit, in the available options.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Best Fit**\n\nI've determined that \"HR Support\" is the optimal category for this ticket. My analysis of the phrases \"per diem,\" \"expense report,\" and \"cost center\" confirmed this, solidifying its placement as the strongest choice. The phrases all point to HR or finance-related administrative responsibilities.\n\n\n"
