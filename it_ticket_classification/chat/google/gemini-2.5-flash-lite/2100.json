Initial assessments point towards potential overlaps, but I'm leaning toward Access as a primary category given the focus on library access and request management. I'm carefully considering potential secondary categories as well.\n\n\n**Pinpointing Primary Category**\n\nI've refined my approach to categorize the ticket. While the text initially indicated potential overlap, I'm now certain that \"Access\" is the most fitting primary category. The phrase \"access to leadership library\" is the core focus of the ticket, which is a strong indicator of access-related work. I am also considering \"Internal Project\" as a secondary category.\n\n\n"
