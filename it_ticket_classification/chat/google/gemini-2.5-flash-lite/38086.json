The text is a bit cryptic, but \"Access\" is looking like the frontrunner, though \"HR Support\" has a slight potential, given the calendar visibility issue. I'm focusing on the permissions aspect. It feels more concrete than the other categories at the moment.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Access Issue**\n\nI've carefully re-evaluated the ticket text. While I initially considered \"HR Support\" due to the calendar aspect, the recurring theme of *access* to calendar availability is now dominant. The phrases like \"unable to view\" and \"fix issue\" point clearly to a permission-based problem. I'm leaning heavily towards \"Access\" now. The updates performed could be related to permission configuration.\n\n\n**Narrowing Access Classification**\n\nI'm now fully committed to \"Access\" as the correct category. The key phrase is \"cannot view... availability,\" repeatedly mentioned. Though administrative rights could be implicated, the primary concern remains *access* to information. Updates performed today suggest a recent change related to permissions.\n\n\n\n"
