I'm leaning toward \"HR Support\" or potentially \"Access,\" but need to determine the primary issue. The \"submit...approval\" wording suggests an HR-related workflow, but the \"error\" raises the prospect of a more general access glitch. I'm focusing on parsing the user's intent to decide where the issue truly belongs.\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nMy focus has shifted towards the HR Support category. The recent review of the ticket text solidifies its relevance. The details point directly to timecard discrepancies and workflow errors. While \"Access\" could be a secondary factor, the core issue revolves around HR processes. The user's struggle with approvals and adherence to process further reinforces \"HR Support\" as the most suitable primary classification.\n\n\n"
