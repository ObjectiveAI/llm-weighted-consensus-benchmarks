I'm considering \"Access\" or potentially a more technical category like \"Storage\" or \"Hardware\" given the error message. I'm weighing these options, trying to rule out irrelevant ones like \"HR Support\" or \"Purchase\". The goal is a precise categorization.\n\n\n**Determining the best fit**\n\nI've narrowed down the category to \"Access\" based on the ticket description referencing a \"certificate problem\" and connection failures, which strongly imply authentication/authorization issues. While \"Administrative Rights\" is tangentially related, \"Access\" is more broadly applicable to the problem described. The other categories are irrelevant because they don't encompass the nature of the issue.\n\n\n**Prioritizing 'Access'**\n\nI'm solidifying the categorization as \"Access.\" The recurrent mention of \"certificate\" coupled with connection failures strongly suggests an authentication and access control issue, far more than anything related to administrative privileges. I've dismissed other categories like \"Storage\" or \"HR Support\" as they have no relevance to the issue. The goal is to accurately classify the issue so it can be handled appropriately.\n\n\n"
