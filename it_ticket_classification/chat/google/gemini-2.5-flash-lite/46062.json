I've successfully incorporated a \"category\" key, and am now working to refine the conditional logic to accurately map the provided text to one of the eight predefined categories: \"Hardware\", \"HR Support\", \"Access\", \"Miscellaneous\", \"Storage\", \"Purchase\", \"Internal Project\", and \"Administrative rights.\" My goal is to maximize the accuracy of the categorization process.\n\n\n**Refining Category Assignment**\n\nI've been working on a new example to ensure the categorization logic is robust. Based on the phrase \"annual leave portal stuck,\" the system is now accurately assigning this type of ticket to \"HR Support.\" It's a significant improvement, and I'm confident in the overall direction. I'm focusing on strengthening the keyword recognition for edge cases like this.\n\n\n**Confirming HR Categorization**\n\nI've just processed the text \"day off stuck somewhere sent monday november off stuck somewhere hello sent several request for annual leave portal looks like stuck somewhere because manager receive anything view days moving well can you where blocking point thank you best regards manager infrastructure.\" The system correctly classified this ticket as \"HR Support\" due to the keywords \"annual leave portal\" and \"day off.\" The logic accurately identified this as an HR-related issue rather than falling into a more general or unrelated category. I feel confident about the assignment.\n\n\n"
