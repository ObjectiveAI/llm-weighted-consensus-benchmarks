The description contains keywords related to \"survey gizmo instances\", \"customer feedback responses\", and \"average satisfaction score trend\". I'm leaning towards \"Miscellaneous\", but I'm open to considering alternative categories like \"Internal Project\" if the survey system is part of a larger initiative. The goal is to accurately represent the ticket's nature and ensure it's routed appropriately.\n\n\n**Defining Data Issues**\n\nI've been analyzing the ticket's description more closely. The core issue is data corruption within SurveyGizmo, leading to incorrect satisfaction scores. The user mentioned values and scores are being converted incorrectly during data processing. This affects dashboards and requires investigation and prevention. I'm leaning toward \"Miscellaneous\" because it encompasses this broad technical problem.\n\n\n**Finalizing Categorization Assessment**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the ticket description, focusing on the data discrepancies. The core is the inconsistent conversion of SurveyGizmo data impacting satisfaction scores. The user reported incorrect calculations during data transfer and reporting, necessitating investigation and future prevention. The \"Miscellaneous\" category remains the most fitting, given the broad technical nature of the problem, and its focus on a specific software's data processing rather than fitting neatly into a single, more precise label.\n\n\n"
