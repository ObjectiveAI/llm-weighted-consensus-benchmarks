                    "reasoning": "**Categorizing Ticket Issues**\n\nI'm currently trying to assign the appropriate category to this IT ticket. I've read the text, and it points towards a few different areas, especially with the mention of \"Oracle\" and potentially something related to authentication or access. I'm focusing on the context to determine the best match from the list: \"Hardware|HR Support|Access|Miscellaneous|Storage|Purchase|Internal Project|Administrative rights\". My primary challenge is correctly interpreting the \"cards were\" text.\n\n\n**Analyzing Access Restrictions**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and the potential categories. The user's problem involves \"cards\" and a missing \"submit\" button, likely linked to the \"Oracle\" and \"hello\" systems. While \"HR Support\" and \"Purchase\" might be relevant, the emphasis is on the inability to *submit*, which strongly indicates an access or permission issue. \"Cards\" could relate to something like user cards, system functionality cards or other such application functionality. I'm leaning towards \"Access,\" but I'm still considering all factors to make the most precise call.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Access Problems**\n\nI've been going through the text again and the possible categories. While \"HR Support\" and \"Purchase\" could relate, the key issue is submission failure and the mention of \"cards\". It leans toward \"Access,\" given the specific systems referenced and the problem with the submit functionality. The language is a bit clunky but the inability to submit cards in either the Oracle or \"Hello\" system strongly suggests that user rights or application configuration within either system is the problem, but it might be just the design of the application .\n\n\n**Focusing on Submission Blocks**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and the possible categories again, specifically considering the meaning of \"cards.\" Given that the core issue is the missing \"submit\" button, even with the presence of cards and specific applications (Oracle, Hello), it points to an access issue. \"Cards\" here seems related to data input needing submission, so it's most likely not HR-specific. I've ruled out \"Hardware,\" \"Storage,\" and \"Internal Project\" as irrelevant. While \"Purchase\" is a possibility, the wording emphasizes a systemic functionality problem within the application.\n\n\n**Deciding Ticket Classification**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on classifying the ticket, considering the systems (\"Oracle,\" \"hello\"), and the \"submit\" button. The inability to submit suggests an access-related issue or potentially an application-specific functional problem. \"Cards\" are still somewhat ambiguous, but the system context points away from pure HR support. I'm focusing on user access and application rights, excluding other possibilities.\n\n\n**Choosing Ticket Category**\n\nI'm now focusing on a classification, considering the \"submit\" button and applications. The core problem of not being able to submit points to access or an application issue. Cards suggest data input. Based on the options, I'm leaning toward 'Access' or 'Miscellaneous,' but I'm still weighing the details.\n\n\n**Classifying the Submission Block**\n\nI've been assessing the text and the categories again, focusing on the ambiguous phrase about the submit button and cards. Now, it seems like the issue is with an *inability* to submit, even with the button present, pointing towards a system-level function or application flaw, not just an access restriction. While 'Access' is still a possibility, I'm now leaning more towards a bug or specific application-related problem. The \"cards\" and system context are key.\n\n\n**Resolving the Ticket Classification**\n\nI'm now classifying the ticket, considering \"Oracle,\" \"hello,\" and the submit button issue. The \"cards\" and system context point away from pure HR. While \"Access\" is still possible, the wording now suggests a functional issue, not simply a lack of rights. Focusing on the submit button's functionality, \"Miscellaneous\" seems a better fit as a general category for software issues. The problem is no longer an obvious block to submitting based on rights, but rather a functional component.\n\n**Resolving the Application Function**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and the categories for what feels like the last time! Now, I think it's an application functional issue. Despite previous assumptions about access, the key phrase, \"submit button displaying there,\" suggests a bug or issue with how the application's UI is working. It is not an obvious access/permission issue, but a defect within the submit function's module. 'Miscellaneous' seems the only logical fit for a general software issue.\n\n\n"
