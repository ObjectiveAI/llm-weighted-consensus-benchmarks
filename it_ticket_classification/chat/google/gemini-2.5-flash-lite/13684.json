The initial analysis leans towards \"HR Support\" due to the mention of \"maternity leave\" and a \"new starter.\" However, the short description is cryptic and the context isn't fully clear. I'm taking into consideration that I need to be exact in my selection.\n\n\n**Prioritizing HR Focus**\n\nMy current focus is solidifying the \"HR Support\" category. While the mention of \"re attached\" might hint at access issues, the primary driver is the phrase \"return from maternity leave.\" This suggests an HR-driven process. I'm prioritizing the strongest signals.\n\n\n**Clarifying HR Association**\n\nI'm now fully committed to the \"HR Support\" classification. Despite the ambiguous \"re attached\" phrase, the core trigger is the maternity leave return. The IT element is likely a supporting action triggered by the HR process. I'm focusing on the reason for the request, and the trigger for the request points to HR.\n\n\n"
