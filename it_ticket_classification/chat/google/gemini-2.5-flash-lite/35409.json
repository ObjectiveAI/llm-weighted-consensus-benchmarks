I'm focusing on keywords and phrases to pinpoint the appropriate category. Initial assessment points toward a potential database or system access issue, but I need to be sure before classifying it. My plan is to use NLP to map keywords to one or more of the predefined categories.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Issue**\n\nI've been examining the IT ticket's text, \"oracle error error hello when try submit get below error can be forwarded handling,\" and I'm homing in on the best category. \"Oracle error\" suggests a database or application fault, while \"submission error\" provides context. Considering the provided categories, \"Miscellaneous\" seems the best fit. I'm excluding others like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and \"Purchase,\" as they don't seem applicable. While the text hints at a possible \"Access\" issue, the \"oracle\" component directs me to \"Miscellaneous.\" I'm also ruling out \"Storage,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights\" based on the described issues.\n\n\n**Defining Ticket Classification**\n\nI've carefully reviewed the IT ticket's text: \"oracle error error hello when try submit get below error can be forwarded handling,\" and the provided categories. The \"oracle error\" element strongly indicates a software or application problem, but the limited categories provided pose a challenge. While \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" might seem plausible, the \"oracle\" component is the key. Given the choices, \"Miscellaneous\" is the best fit, as the error doesn't clearly align with the more specific options. I'm focusing on classifying the ticket now, considering its vague nature. \"Software\" or \"Application Error\" would be ideal.\n\n\n"
