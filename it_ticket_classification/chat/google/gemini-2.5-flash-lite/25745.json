Based on the available options (\"Hardware|HR Support|Access|Miscellaneous|Storage|Purchase|Internal Project|Administrative rights\"), my initial thought is that \"HR Support\" seems most relevant, as it likely relates to leave tracking, which falls under human resources. I'm exploring potential keywords and context further.\n\n\n**Evaluating the Context**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the text, looking for the best fit within the provided schema.  Focusing on the repeated terms like \"leave,\" \"absence,\" and \"holidays,\" I'm leaning toward either \"HR Support\" or \"Internal Project.\"  The phrases \"keeping track of\" and \"add calendar\" further solidified my thinking, leading me to believe it is likely an internal project to make something to help keep track of HR related data.\n\n\n**Narrowing the Focus**\n\nI'm now fully convinced that the ticket falls under \"HR Support.\" The analysis of keywords like \"leaves,\" \"absences,\" \"holidays,\" \"sickness,\" and the reference to \"bosses\" seeking information solidified this. The phrases \"keeping track,\" \"add calendar,\" and the temporary nature of changes further point toward an HR-related need for managing employee status. \"Internal Project\" doesn't quite capture the ongoing administrative nature of the request, making \"HR Support\" the clear frontrunner.\n\n\n"
