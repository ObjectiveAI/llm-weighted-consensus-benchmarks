I'm analyzing the ticket's content to determine if it aligns with any of these predefined classifications.\n\n**Selecting Ticket Category**\n\nI'm currently evaluating the provided IT ticket details to pinpoint the most accurate category. The ticket discusses project assignments, verification of names, and annual leave requests in the context of project members, leaning me towards \"HR Support\" due to the leave request element, but the overall theme of project resource allocation is also prominent.\n\n**Refining Project Ticket Category**\n\nI've finalized my categorization for the IT ticket. After careful consideration of the themes surrounding project assignments, name verification, and even annual leave requests within the project context, I've determined that \"Internal Project\" is the most accurate classification.\n\n"
