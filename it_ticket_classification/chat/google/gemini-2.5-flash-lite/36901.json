Currently, I am analyzing the contents of the ticket which appears to detail an issue regarding a second monitor after an upgrade. It seems like the solution is a driver reinstallation, which is helpful to note. I'm focusing on the schema provided to match the problem description with the most relevant category.\n\n\n**Defining the Category**\n\nI've thoroughly reviewed the ticket content again. It's unequivocally pointing towards a \"Hardware\" issue. I analyzed each of the provided categories against the problem description. While \"Access\" could be a stretch, the core issue centers on a malfunctioning monitor post-upgrade, directly involving a hardware component and its driver. Thus, \"Hardware\" is the most appropriate and precise categorization.\n\n\n"
