The keywords don't immediately point to a specific IT area. I'm leaning toward \"Miscellaneous\" as the best fit, but I'll double-check for any hidden indicators.\n\n\n**Narrowing the Options**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the most suitable category. The initial assessment suggests \"Miscellaneous,\" but I need to ensure there isn't a more specific fit. The ServiceNow reference does bring IT-related areas into consideration, however, the request for a change to an existing platform feature doesn't neatly align with any of the options. I'll re-evaluate the context of the platform in relation to the list.\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nI'm now deeply analyzing the \"Internal Project\" category. It seems to resonate the most, as the user seeks an improvement within their project teams' workflow. I've broken down the request, focusing on \"ServiceNow\" and the described functionality. My analysis suggests that the request, although a platform change, is to improve project processes. The need for the change comes from project teams, rather than a generic IT concern.\n\n\n**Determining the best fit**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the context and request details. The phrase \"commercial projects teams\" still solidifies \"Internal Project\" as the most appropriate category. The user isn't requesting a generic IT change but an improvement to their project-specific processes within the ServiceNow platform. This is looking very solid now.\n\n\n**Focusing on Internal Processes**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the context and request details. The phrase \"commercial projects teams\" reinforces \"Internal Project\" as the most suitable category. The user isn't requesting a broad IT change but rather an enhancement to their project-specific processes within the ServiceNow platform. I'm solidifying my focus.\n\n\n**Focusing on Internal Processes**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the context and request details.

Analyzing the provided context, the user's request pertains to improving project-related processes. Considering the \"commercial projects teams\" and their workflows, it indicates an internal system improvement request. This falls squarely under the \"Internal Project\" umbrella. I'm now confident in the final categorization.\n\n\n"
