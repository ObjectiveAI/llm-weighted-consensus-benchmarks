Initial analysis suggests the subject relates to a \"new starter\", which leans towards HR Support or Access, but further clarification is required before reaching a firm conclusion. I'll need to look for specific keywords to make sure.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Ticket**\n\nI've thoroughly analyzed the ticket content, and the \"new starter\" element strongly points towards HR Support. While access setup is likely involved, it's part of the broader onboarding process within HR's domain. The remaining phrase doesn't contribute significantly to the categorization. I'm now leaning heavily towards classifying this ticket under HR Support.\n\n\n**Assessing Ticket Content**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the \"new starter\" aspect and the available categories. It seems the ticket primarily concerns HR onboarding, though Access could be relevant. I've eliminated Hardware, Storage, Purchase, and Internal Project as they are irrelevant. I've noticed a connection between HR support and the initial access setup for a new team member; it's a critical link. I'm going to look deeper into the Access option. I'm focusing on clarifying how it fits within the context of the HR Support category.\n\n\n"
