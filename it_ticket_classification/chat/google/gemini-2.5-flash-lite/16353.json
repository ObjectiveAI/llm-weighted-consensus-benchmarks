After analyzing the text (\"new starter service now wednesday pm re date hi requisition\"), I'm leaning towards \"HR Support.\" It seems to revolve around onboarding a new employee and possibly involves setting up their access or requisitioning equipment, all falling under HR-related processes. I'm double-checking, but that's my main conclusion right now.\n\n\n**Analyzing Onboarding Needs**\n\nI'm now fully immersed in the IT ticket's content, focusing on what this \"new starter\" requires. The consistent references to a \"starter form,\" along with the mention of a mobile phone subscription, solidify my previous leaning towards \"HR Support.\" It seems like the core issue revolves around getting this new hire set up with the necessary tools and services to begin working, which is a key HR process. I've ruled out other categories since they don't seem to align directly.\n\n\n**Finalizing Category Selection**\n\nI've meticulously analyzed the IT ticket's text, identifying key phrases such as \"new starter\" and \"starter form,\" and how the \"mobile phone subscription\" fits the context. Initially, I considered \"Access\" and \"Purchase,\" but after further reflection, \"HR Support\" emerges as the definitive fit. I am convinced that the primary focus of the ticket lies in onboarding a new employee and facilitating their initial setup; the phone package is a service associated with the onboarding needs, making it a clear HR process.\n\n\n"
