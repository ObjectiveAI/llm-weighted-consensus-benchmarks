Based on the context, I'm leaning toward \"Access\" being the appropriate category. I'm exploring additional criteria for accuracy in other situations where the words used might point in different directions.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the essence of the ticket. The user can't access and submit the leaver form.  While \"Access\" remains relevant due to the initial block, I'm now leaning heavily toward \"HR Support\" because the form itself ties directly to an HR process. Although browser and application issues exist, the fundamental barrier is completing an HR-related task. The \"HR Support\" categorization seems most accurate.\n\n\n**Confirming HR Process Focus**\n\nI've been going through the process of determining the best category and it now leans strongly toward \"HR Support\". The leaver form clearly ties into HR procedures, so although there is an access challenge, the heart of the issue is preventing the user from completing an HR-related task. This feels like the right fit and is the current focus of the process. I am certain about that the core process is the target here.\n\n\n"
