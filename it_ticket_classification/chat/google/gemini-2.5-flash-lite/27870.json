I'm carefully analyzing the keywords \"new starter,\" \"Thursday,\" \"October,\" \"PM,\" \"starter form,\" and \"hello ext\". This seems to align with either HR Support or Access, though I'm leaning toward HR Support. The absence of hardware-related terms is notable. I'm trying to decide whether the \"ext\" implies external access needs.\n\n\n**Revising Category Choice**\n\nI've re-evaluated my initial inclination towards \"HR Support\". While it's still a strong contender, the \"ext\" in the description is now making me consider \"Access\" more carefully. Since the ticket involves a new starter, it likely means they need access to company systems. The \"ext\" could indicate a need for external access, which would definitively point towards the \"Access\" category. I am now leaning more toward selecting Access as the definitive ticket category, but will assess this in more detail.\n\n\n**Choosing HR Support**\n\nI have carefully assessed the context and have determined that this ticket is centered around the onboarding of a \"new starter\". This indicates a strong association with a process commonly initiated and coordinated by Human Resources. Specifically, with the \"starter form\" referenced, I am comfortable with categorizing this under HR Support. This category best represents the overall workflow of the ticket, which is the initiation of onboarding via a form, often managed with HR as the primary driver, to coordinate IT setup.\n\n\n"
