It's difficult. It seems like it could fall into 'Miscellaneous' or 'Administrative Rights'. I'm leaning toward 'Miscellaneous' as the primary classification, but it's a tough call.\n\n\n**Analyzing the Text**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket text and the provided categories. The focus on \"promotion proposals\" significantly shifts my perspective. After carefully weighing all the options, I now believe \"HR Support\" is the most accurate category. While \"Internal Project\" was initially considered, the HR element feels more central to the issue described in the ticket. The core activity involves managing and making decisions about proposals, which is closely aligned with HR responsibilities.\n\n\n"
