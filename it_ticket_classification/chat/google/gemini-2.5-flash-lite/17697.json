The text is brief: \"grade change oracle for friday grade change hello please\". It looks like the issue may be around an \"oracle\" change, so maybe an access issue, but the wording is a bit vague. I'm still trying to discern the exact intent and the most appropriate category amongst the given possibilities. \n\n\n**Re-evaluating the Options**\n\nI'm now focusing on the context clues within the expanded ticket text. The repeated phrases \"grade change\" and \"job title change\" firmly point toward an HR-related issue, specifically concerning employee data management, possibly within Oracle. I'm leaning heavily towards \"HR Support\" as the most precise category. \"Internal Project\" is a possibility but feels too broad, given the specific data manipulation described. The other categories are clearly irrelevant.\n\n\n**Confirming the Classification**\n\nI've completed my analysis of the full ticket text, which solidified my initial assumption. The phrases \"grade change\" and \"job title change\" are central, alongside \"employee data\" context. \"HR Support\" is the clearest category. The inclusion of \"Oracle\" likely relates to the system used for employee data management. I can eliminate the other choices: \"Internal Project\" is too broad, and the rest are entirely irrelevant. I am confident that \"HR Support\" is the correct classification.\n\n\n"
