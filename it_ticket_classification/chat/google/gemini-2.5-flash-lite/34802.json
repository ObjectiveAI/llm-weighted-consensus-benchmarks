The keywords strongly point towards an issue related to employee self-service or HR systems. I'm focusing on \"annual leave\" and the inability to \"specify task details\" within that context to pinpoint the most appropriate category. My initial leaning is towards \"HR Support\", but I need to ensure this is the best fit.\n\n\n**Defining Ticket Category**\n\nI've reviewed the provided ticket content, which emphasizes \"annual leave\" and difficulties with \"task details.\" Considering the predefined categories, \"HR Support\" appears the most relevant. The user seems to be facing an issue with the employee self-service system. I am confident that the root cause of this ticket is HR-related and can confirm the appropriate category is \"HR Support\".\n\n\n"
