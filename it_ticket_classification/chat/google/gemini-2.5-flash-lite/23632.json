                    "reasoning": "**Deciding the Category**\n\nI'm currently mulling over the best category for this ticket. The \"room refresh\" focus and keywords like \"meeting rooms\" and \"cables\" have me leaning heavily towards \"Hardware,\" as it seems a physical infrastructure issue. I'm also considering \"Miscellaneous\" but it seems less fitting.\n\n\n**Refining Category Choice**\n\nI'm now leaning further toward \"Internal Project\" as the best fit. While \"Hardware\" was initially considered, the broader scope of \"room refresh,\" involving multiple physical changes and possibly planning, seems more project-oriented. The \"cables\" aspect now feels like a supporting detail within this larger initiative. I'll need to confirm this with the user, of course.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Project Scope**\n\nI've been further refining my thoughts, and the \"Internal Project\" category is solidifying as the most suitable. While \"Hardware\" is still relevant to the cabling work, the \"room refresh\" aspect is increasingly making me think of a broader, more holistic project. This refresh appears planned and coordinated, going beyond simple hardware fixes. The multiple elements of the ticket point to \"Internal Project\" as the better fit, while \"Hardware\" feels like a sub-element.\n\n\n**Defining Project's Scope**\n\nI've been honing my categorization and currently favor \"Internal Project\" as the best fit. Although the ticket mentions hardware aspects, the broader scope implied by \"room refresh\" leans towards project planning. The \"move cables,\" \"fix tv wall,\" and \"clean up cables\" tasks are now perceived as elements within a larger initiative. The project's overall nature suggests a planned upgrade, not a simple hardware repair.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Refresh**\n\nI'm now concluding that \"Internal Project\" best represents this ticket. \"Room refresh\" indicates a planned effort, not simply a hardware fix. While the work involves hardware (cables, TVs), the broader scope and potential coordination across multiple rooms leans towards a project-based initiative. I'm satisfied this captures the essence of the request.\n\n\n**Defining the Scope**\n\nI'm now grappling with the finer details of the categorization, and I'm leaning heavily towards \"Internal Project\" as the most appropriate fit. While hardware work is involved, the concept of a \"room refresh,\" particularly across multiple meeting rooms, indicates a broader scope beyond simple hardware fixes. The tasks listed, like cable management and TV wall adjustments, are now seen as components within a larger, planned initiative to modernize these spaces, thus solidifying my belief in \"Internal Project\".\n\n\n**Deciding on Final Categorization**\n\nMy latest thought process is centered on the best category: \"Internal Project\" is still the front-runner. The user's request, with its focus on meeting room upgrades and cable management, reads as a planned undertaking, and I am leaning toward the \"Internal Project\" category. I am working through a detailed analysis, and I feel confident this categorization will address the core of the request.\n\n\n**Refining Categorization Decision**\n\nI'm now contemplating whether to categorize this as an \"Internal Project\" or if a more specific category like \"Hardware\" is appropriate for the tasks in the ticket. While \"room refresh\" initially suggested a project, the specific hardware tasks like cable management and TV wall repair are central to the request. The emphasis on individual hardware components makes \"Hardware\" more attractive than initially thought.\n\n\n**Defining Core Categorization**\n\nI'm now struggling with the core categorization. While \"Internal Project\" implies planned work, the concrete tasks in the ticket, such as cable management and TV wall repair, lean heavily toward a \"Hardware\" focus. The user is asking for these specific hardware-related tasks; the broader scope suggested by \"room refresh\" is secondary to the physical work required.\n\n\n**Revisiting Hardware vs. Internal Project**\n\nI'm now torn between \"Hardware\" and \"Internal Project.\" While the initial focus was on the hardware-related tasks (cables, TV), \"room refresh\" implies a broader scope, potentially indicating a larger project. However, the concrete tasks described seem central to a hardware setup or upgrade. I'm leaning toward \"Hardware\" given the ticket's emphasis on physical adjustments.\n\n\n**Revising Category Choice**\n\nAfter reviewing all options, I've decided **re-categorizing** the ticket under \"Hardware\" feels more accurate. Although \"Internal Project\" was tempting for the \"room refresh,\" the ticket's focus is on specific hardware tasks: moving cables, fixing TV walls, and managing cables. These actions strongly align with hardware-related work. I've re-assessed the ticket's purpose, so this is the best fit.\n\n\n"
