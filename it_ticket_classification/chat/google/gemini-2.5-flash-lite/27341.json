The key phrases \"access control lists,\" \"restrict folder,\" and \"sensitive information\" are making me lean heavily toward \"Access.\" However, the mention of \"backup demand folder\" has me briefly considering \"Storage.\" I'm weighing these two options and considering if this should be a combined or alternative categorization. Ultimately, I am leaning towards the access category.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've decided \"Access\" is the most fitting categorization. The prevalence of \"access control lists,\" \"restrict folder,\" and the inherent nature of controlling who sees sensitive data cemented my choice. While \"Storage\" briefly surfaced due to \"backup demand,\" the fundamental focus is on access management.\n\n\n**Deciding on the Primary Focus**\n\nI'm now fully committed to \"Access\" as the primary category. While \"Storage\" briefly appeared due to the mention of backups and file storage, the core concern is about who has permission to access these resources. \"Access control lists\" and \"restrict folder\" are explicitly about access management. \"Access\" is the only one that truly encompasses this core. Even though the backups relate to storage, the core is *who* gets to see or change it.\n\n\n**Refining the Core Action**\n\nI've honed in on the central issue: *access* to files, even those backed up. The concern about restricting folders, ACLs, and protecting sensitive data makes \"Access\" the indisputable primary category. While \"backup demand\" highlights storage, the crux is about *who* accesses this.\n\n\n**Focusing the Core Action**\n\nAfter meticulously examining the available options, I've confirmed that \"Access\" is the most precise fit. Even though the ticket mentions \"backup demand\" and \"file storage,\" the central request revolves around controlling access to these resources. \"Access control lists\" and \"restrict folder\" are explicitly about managing permissions, solidifying \"Access\" as the primary category.\n\n\n**Determining the Precise Scope**\n\nI've determined that \"Access\" is the most accurate category. While \"Storage\" is relevant due to mentions of backups, the heart of this ticket lies in *controlling* access. The request focuses on restricting access via ACLs and protecting sensitive information. Therefore, \"Access\" is clearly the best fit and I have decided to go with that.\n\n\n"
