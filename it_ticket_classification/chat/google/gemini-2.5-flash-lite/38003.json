My goal is to determine the most relevant category from the provided schema (Hardware, HR, Access, etc.). Right now, I lean towards Access, but further context is needed.\n\n\n**Defining the Category**\n\nI've determined the key phrases from the ticket text: \"expired password,\" \"password expire,\" and requests for reset/unlock. These clearly point to an \"Access\" issue within the provided categorization schema. After eliminating other irrelevant categories like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and others, \"Access\" remains the most precise fit for this specific ticket. The issue centers on password-related access problems, making \"Access\" the definitive category.\n\n\n"
