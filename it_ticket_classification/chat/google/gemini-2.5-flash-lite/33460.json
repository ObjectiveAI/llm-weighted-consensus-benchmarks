Initially, \"feedback question\" suggested a user experience or HR-related issue. However, \"hard navigation\" and \"lost too\" point strongly toward an accessibility or usability problem. This suggests a **user experience** is at play here. I'm leaning toward \"Miscellaneous\" because of the broadness of the problem, but I'll need more context to be sure.\n\n\n**Refining Categorization Focus**\n\nThe ticket's keywords strongly suggest a usability problem; I'm no longer considering HR. \"Hard navigation\" and \"lost feedback\" are key phrases pointing to a system usability issue. Considering all of this, \"Miscellaneous\" seems to be the most accurate category, as the described problem doesn't clearly involve any other listed categories. I am leaning toward a system-related \"Miscellaneous\" category to capture this feedback.\n\n\n"
