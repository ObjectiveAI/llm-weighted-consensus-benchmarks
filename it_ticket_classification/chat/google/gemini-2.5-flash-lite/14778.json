While \"Access\" or \"HR Support\" seemed plausible initially due to the mention of personnel changes, I'm now leaning towards \"Internal Project\" as the most fitting category, given the context of managing \"evaluators\" for specific tasks rather than broad system access or HR functions.\n\n**Refining Ticket Categorization**\n\nI'm currently exploring the most precise classification for this IT ticket. After considering \"HR Support\" and \"Access\" based on personnel aspects, I've concluded that \"Internal Project\" better captures the essence of managing specific roles like \"technical evaluators\" for distinct tasks.\n\n**Finalizing Ticket Assignment**\n\nI've analyzed the ticket details, specifically the mentions of adding and removing \"technical evaluators.\" After considering all available categories, I've concluded that \"Internal Project\" most accurately reflects the management of personnel for evaluation tasks within a defined scope.\n\n"
