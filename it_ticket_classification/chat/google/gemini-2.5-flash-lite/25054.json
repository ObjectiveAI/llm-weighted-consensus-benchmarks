Considering the available options, I am leaning toward \"Hardware\" because it directly addresses a physical device needing replacement. The other categories don't seem like the best fit here. I'll need to confirm this is the best classification, as no other aspects of the request are mentioned in the text.\n\n\n**Analyzing the Ticket**\n\nI've carefully reviewed the ticket description and the available categories. It's clear that the main problem is a broken headset. Focusing on the options, \"Hardware\" stands out as the most suitable. Categories like \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and \"Storage\" don't seem applicable here. While \"Miscellaneous\" could be an option, \"Hardware\" is more precise for this case. Therefore, I will categorize the ticket as \"Hardware\".\n\n\n"
