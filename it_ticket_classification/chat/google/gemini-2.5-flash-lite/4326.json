Given the information - \"submit leave\" and \"verbal\" - I am analyzing how best to proceed. It seems the ticket relates to HR support. My goal is to determine the most relevant category.\n\n\n**Determining Best Fit Category**\n\nI've been analyzing the ticket details, and it's crystal clear that this pertains to an HR matter. The keywords (\"submit leave,\" \"sick note,\" \"annual leave,\" etc.) confirm this. The discussion revolves around employee leave, doctor's notes, and HR-related procedures. Therefore, my selection is firmly on \"HR Support\" as the most suitable category for this ticket.\n\n\n"
