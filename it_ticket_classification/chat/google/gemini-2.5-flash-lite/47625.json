My primary task involves sifting through the details to pinpoint the most fitting category from \"Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, Administrative rights\". \"Access\" seems probable at this moment, but I need to investigate further to confirm.\n\n\n**Refining Access Criteria**\n\nI'm now refining the \"Access\" category assignment. The key phrase \"issue with report visibility\" points strongly towards an access control issue or a permissions problem. The text \"can only subset reports\" and \"same problem exists client reports\" further solidifies this deduction, as the user clearly lacks adequate permissions for complete report access. I'm leaning toward Access as the definitive category based on the current evidence.\n\n\n**Pinpointing Access Issue**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the specifics of the access problem. The user's inability to view past reports (before July) and the \"subset\" restriction strongly suggest insufficient access privileges. The phrase \"same problem exists client reports\" further solidifies this, indicating a broad access limitation, not a hardware or HR concern. My primary focus now is to confirm this diagnosis and look for potential root causes related to user roles, permissions or data filtering issues within the reporting system.\n\n\n"
