The key phrases \"unable to delete document\", \"check locked\", and \"delete document\" strongly suggest a **Storage** related issue. I'm focusing on storage access.\n\n\n**Narrowing Access Issue**\n\nI'm zeroing in on the **Access** category. The ticket describes \"unable to delete\" and a \"locked\" file, and the phrases \"signature locked for shared use\" and \"cum pot face unlock\". These point to a definite access problem. I've ruled out storage as the core issue is about accessing and managing, not storage capacity.  'Administrative rights' is related, but access seems more user-level.\n\n\n**Confirming Access Focus**\n\nI've re-evaluated the ticket description. The combination of \"unable to delete\", \"locked\", and \"signature locked for shared use\" solidifies the **Access** category as the best fit. I've considered and eliminated other categories like Storage and Administrative rights, focusing on the user's inability to manage the file, indicating a permissions or sharing issue. I'm now fully convinced that access control is the central problem, not storage capacity or elevated privileges.\n\n\n"
