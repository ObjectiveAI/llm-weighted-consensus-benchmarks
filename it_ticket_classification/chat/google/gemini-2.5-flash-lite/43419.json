The text mentions \"people who left\" and \"sent wednesday march left,\" which strongly suggests a potential HR-related issue. My initial inclination is to assign it to the \"HR Support\" category, but I need to ensure it doesn't fit another option before finalizing this classification.\n\n\n**Narrowing HR Support Focus**\n\nI've refined my initial classification. While access deprovisioning is possible, the core issue seems to be centered around employees *leaving* and their associated roles. This solidifies my view that \"HR Support\" is the most appropriate category, and I'm confident in the assignment.\n\n\n**Determining the Core Action**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket's text, focusing on the \"left\" keywords and the listed employee roles. It's clear that the primary action involves employees departing the company. Therefore, while access deprovisioning is *implied*, the root issue is an HR-driven event. My assessment leads me to categorize this ticket as \"HR Support.\"\n\n\n"
