So far, the phrase \"site visit\" and \"mice issue\" make me consider \"Hardware\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" The remaining words are not very helpful but should be considered. My aim is to apply my expertise to discern the primary issue and the optimal category for it.\n\n\n**Identifying Hardware Problems**\n\nI've honed in on the hardware issues within the IT ticket text. My current analysis highlights \"mice issue\" and a non-responsive computer/monitor as the central problems. The phone being operational confirms the focus on hardware malfunctions. This leads me to believe the appropriate categorization is \"Hardware\".\n\n\n**Focusing on Hardware Diagnosis**\n\nMy analysis now definitively classifies the ticket as \"Hardware\". The \"mice issue\" and the described computer/monitor failure are the core problems. The user mentions that the phone *was* working; the emphasis is on what *wasn't* working (hardware) as opposed to what was. I can confidently say that these issues strongly indicate a hardware categorization.\n\n\n"
