So far, the phrase \"rd floor tower connected splitter\" suggests a hardware-related issue. However, further analysis is underway to confirm this assumption. I'm considering other categories, like access, in case the connection issue relates to restricted access.\n\n\n**Confirming Hardware Focus**\n\nI'm now certain the ticket concerns a hardware issue, specifically setting up network connectivity. The core request revolves around connecting a \"rd floor tower\" with a \"splitter,\" strongly indicating a physical equipment setup. While \"Access\" could be a secondary consideration, the primary emphasis is on the physical connection, making \"Hardware\" the most fitting category.\n\n\n**Finalizing Hardware Categorization**\n\nI've determined that the ticket clearly concerns a hardware setup. The phrases \"rd floor tower,\" \"splitter,\" and the overall request to \"connect\" these components leave little doubt. While network access might be involved, the core request is a physical connection, solidifying \"Hardware\" as the appropriate category. I'm now fully confident in this classification.\n\n\n"
