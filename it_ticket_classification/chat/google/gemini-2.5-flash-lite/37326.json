My process involves analyzing the text to identify keyphrases and match them with predefined categories like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and others. Initial analysis suggests the ticket might fall under \"Hardware.\" Now, I'm examining \"for\" statements to pinpoint the exact issue.\n\n\n**Investigating Connectivity Problems**\n\nI'm now investigating a ticket detailing \"notification connection\" issues. The first part mentioned a connection attempt with a certificate error. The second part highlights connectivity issues being actively investigated with high priority, which leans toward \"Access\". The previous analysis of the keyphrases confirms an access issue. I am now classifying this ticket under \"Access\" based on the information provided.\n\n\n**Defining Ticket Category Further**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket, focusing on the core problem: \"notification connection\" and accessibility. While I initially considered \"Access,\" I went back and confirmed my choice. Keywords like \"connection unavailable\" and \"issues with access\" sealed the deal. I'm now certain this falls squarely within the \"Access\" category. The certificate error also points to access difficulties.\n\n\n"
