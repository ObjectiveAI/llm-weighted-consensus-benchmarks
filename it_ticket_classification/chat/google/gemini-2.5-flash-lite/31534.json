My current assessment leans towards classifying \"add holiday rights\" under \"Access,\" as it most closely aligns with provisioning specific user permissions within a system, rather than a general HR query.\n\n**Classifying Ticket Request**\n\nI'm currently reviewing the IT ticket text \"add to the com tuesday pm hello please add holiday rights thanks senior holiday.\" My analysis is focused on keywords that best align with the provided categories, specifically distinguishing between \"HR Support\" and \"Access\" based on the core intent of the request.\n\n**Assigning System Privileges**\n\nI've refined my analysis and have concluded that the IT ticket \"add holiday rights\" most accurately falls under the \"Access\" category, as it pertains to granting specific user permissions within a system rather than a broad HR function.\n\n"
