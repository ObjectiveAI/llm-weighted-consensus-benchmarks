The text presents challenges due to its lack of complete sentences and some errors. Trying to determine if it is hardware, access, or other. I believe it's leaning more toward hardware.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Issue**\n\nThe analysis points strongly to \"Hardware\" as the correct category, given the machine-related boot failures.  No other category seems to fit as well.  The disruptive behavior and manual booting reinforce the hardware nature of the problem. Further investigation supports that this is a hardware-related issue, rather than HR, access, or other categories.\n\n\n"
