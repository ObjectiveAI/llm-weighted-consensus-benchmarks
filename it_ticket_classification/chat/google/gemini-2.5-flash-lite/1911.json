The phrase \"address range\" and \"azure restrictions rule filter\" point towards a network configuration issue within an Azure environment. This could potentially fall under either \"Access\" or \"Storage,\" but the emphasis seems more access-focused. I'm leaning towards \"Access,\" but need more context to be sure.\n\n\n**Narrowing Access Classification**\n\nI've further refined my initial thoughts. The phrases \"IP addresses\" and \"colleagues accessing resources\" solidified my \"Access\" classification. While the ticket touches on Azure, it isn't specifically storage-related, nor is it about hardware or HR. Access control configuration, a core aspect, strongly suggests \"Access.\" I considered other categories, but \"Access\" is the most precise and relevant classification.\n\n\n**Defining Access Configuration**\n\nI've carefully dissected the ticket text, identifying key phrases like \"Azure resources,\" \"IP addresses,\" and \"colleagues accessing.\" The core issue revolves around configuring access rules within Azure, specifically IP restrictions and colleague access. \"Access\" is clearly the best fit, as it addresses the core request to manage resource accessibility and security. I've ruled out \"Storage,\" \"Hardware,\" and other categories, as they don't capture the essence of this access-control scenario.\n\n\n"
