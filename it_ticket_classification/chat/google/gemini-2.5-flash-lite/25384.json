I'm noting potential overlap, such as the distinction between \"Purchase\" and \"Hardware,\" and how subtle clues may affect classification. I also need to make sure I don't use more than 50 words.\n\n\n**Defining Access Points**\n\nI've homed in on \"Access\" as the primary category, but I'm also considering \"Storage\" due to the mentions of files, folders, and migration. The ticket's focus seems to be on adjusting permissions and clarifying where files will be stored after migration, which requires granting and verifying the right level of access to data. This is more related to Access. I will continue to analyze the provided text to refine this further.\n\n\n**Analyzing Access Points**\n\nI've re-evaluated and narrowed down the focus. While storage is involved, the primary action requested centers on modifying access: granting, reviewing, and verifying the right level of user access. Adjusting member rights and team folder permissions are the core actions. The migration is just context and should not cause confusion.\n\n\n**Confirming the Core Action**\n\nI've re-evaluated the ticket description. The key phrases consistently point to Access. Although storage is mentioned, it serves as the environment or context for the requested access adjustments. The core action requested focuses on modifying \"rights\" and \"member rights\", confirming my primary classification decision.\n\n\n**Defining the Primary Category**\n\nI'm now fully committed to \"Access\" as the dominant category. The text consistently highlights requests related to adjusting \"rights,\" which include member and administrative permissions. While storage and migration are mentioned, they are the backdrop to the core action: controlling and managing access to the data. I'll maintain my focus on this.\n\n\n"
