The key factors I'm using for classification are \"internal audit,\" \"user list,\" and \"disable accounts.\" I've narrowed down the choices based on the potential categories, and I'm leaning toward selecting the most suitable category.\n\n\n**Categorizing the IT Ticket**\n\nI've carefully analyzed the ticket text, considering keywords like \"internal audit,\" \"user list,\" and \"disable accounts.\" While \"Access\" is relevant, the core issue of deactivating accounts for departing employees strongly aligns with \"HR Support.\" The context of \"leavers\" and \"employee active accounts\" solidified this choice. This ensures the correct team will handle it.\n\n\n**Defining the Best Fit**\n\nI'm now carefully evaluating the best category, given the provided text. It mentions \"internal audit,\" \"user list,\" and \"disable accounts,\" along with \"leavers\" and \"employee active accounts.\" While \"Access\" is a possibility, the context of departing employees strongly aligns with \"HR Support\" for deactivating accounts. I'm focusing on the core function. This context makes the selection clear.\n\n\n"
