My current thinking is that the phrase \"not able to access internal project board\" strongly suggests \"Internal Project\" is the correct category. \"Able\" to access isn't relevant, the issue is a user is unable to access an internal project. I'm focusing on keywords and phrases, and prioritizing specific mentions of allowed categories.\n\n\n**Narrowing Category Focus**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the \"Access\" and \"Internal Project\" categories. My current line of thought prioritizes \"Access\" because the root problem is the *inability* to access, even if that access is to an internal project board. Keywords like \"not able to\" are driving my decision toward the broader category of \"Access.\" I'm weighing whether specifying \"Internal Project\" adds crucial information given the core issue.\n\n\n**Pinpointing Access Issue**\n\nI've re-evaluated the ticket text, recognizing that \"not able to access\" trumps the \"internal project\" detail. The core problem is the inability to *access* something. Focusing on the phrase \"not able to access\" highlights that the issue is the act of accessing, even if it's an internal project board. The \"Internal Project\" detail is secondary to the access issue itself. The analysis supports \"Access\" as the more precise category.\n\n\n"
