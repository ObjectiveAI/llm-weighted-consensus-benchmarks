This is a critical step in streamlining ticket processing.\n\n\n**Classifying the New Ticket**\n\nI've just finished categorizing the latest IT ticket as \"HR Support\". The text, concerning a new employee's activation, clearly points toward this choice. While \"Access\" was a possible contender, \"HR Support\" is more comprehensive given the context of employee onboarding. I've ruled out the other options as they don't align with the ticket's core issue, which is related to employee status and setup.\n\n\n"
