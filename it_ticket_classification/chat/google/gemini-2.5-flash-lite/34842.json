The text mentions \"time cards for approval\" and \"submit,\" which points strongly towards a category, but I need to be sure before I make the call.\n\n\n**Confirming Category Choice**\n\nI've carefully reviewed the ticket text again. The phrases \"time cards for approval,\" \"submit,\" \"review,\" \"rejected,\" and \"resubmit\" leave no doubt. This definitively falls under \"HR Support,\" aligning with time tracking and submission. I am ready to finalize my categorization.\n\n\n"
