The recurring mention of \"macs conflict issue\" and its spread among colleagues strongly suggests a problem directly related to the hardware itself, specifically Apple Mac devices.\n\n**Classifying IT Issues**\n\nI'm currently reviewing the provided IT ticket text. My analysis indicates the recurring problem with \"macs conflict issue\" affecting multiple colleagues strongly points towards a hardware-related problem.\n\n**Resolving Mac Conflicts**\n\nI'm continuing to refine my understanding of the IT ticket's core issue. The repeated mention of \"macs conflict issue\" and its widespread impact across multiple colleagues strongly indicates a problem rooted in the hardware itself, or its immediate operating environment.\n\n**Assigning IT Ticket Category**\n\nI've reviewed the provided text and, based on the recurring mention of \"macs conflict issue\" affecting multiple colleagues, I've determined the most appropriate category to be **Hardware**.\n\n"
