I'm building logic to parse the ticket text, identify keywords and context, and confidently select the most appropriate category according to the schema.\n\n\n**Evaluating the Keywords**\n\nI've been honing my analysis of the ticket text, zeroing in on keywords like \"joiners,\" \"infrastructure,\" and the broader context. \"Joiners\" keeps suggesting access-related tasks, as new employees often need infrastructure setup, which aligns with 'access'. Also, \"infrastructure\" is a repeated term. I'm leaning toward 'Access' as the best fit. I'm exploring how to weigh the importance of \"cloud services\" with a human understanding and logic that is similar to an expert.\n\n\n**Assessing Ticket Content**\n\nI'm now diving deeper into the nuances of the ticket text, paying close attention to phrases like \"please add onto joiners\" and their relation to \"cloud and infrastructure services\". I believe this highlights the focus on user onboarding and account setup. I'm thinking of how the \"environment print\" wording may also relate to access. I'm focusing on the overall context, and I'm leaning toward selecting 'Access' again as the most appropriate category.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Ticket Components**\n\nI'm now deeply engaged in separating the core request from less relevant details. Phrases such as \"please add onto joiners\" and the recurring mention of \"infrastructure\" are guiding my analysis. The \"environment print\" wording seems less important; it could be a reference to a particular set of services within the onboarding process, which is still about access to resources. My focus remains on the primary request: enabling infrastructure for these new employees, further solidifying my inclination towards 'Access'. I'm aiming for a categorization that captures the central task.\n\n\n"
