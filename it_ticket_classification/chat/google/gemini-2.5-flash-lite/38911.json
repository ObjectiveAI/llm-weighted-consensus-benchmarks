The core issue seems related to calendar access and sharing, suggesting a potential access or application problem. I'm leaning toward eliminating categories unrelated to access, like hardware or purchase, to narrow my choice.\n\n\n**Defining the Problem Space**\n\nI've refined my thinking by focusing on the core issue: the inability to access or view a calendar. The phrase \"re sharing invitation\" led me to consider access permissions. \"Access\" is looking more appropriate than the alternatives. I'm moving away from any category that seems unrelated to granting or denying calendar permissions or a failure in its use.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Access Considerations**\n\nI've narrowed the focus, prioritizing \"Access\" as the most appropriate category. The phrases about not viewing the calendar in Outlook and issues with \"re sharing invitation\" solidified this decision. The key is that the user can't *use* the calendar, and the \"Access\" bucket is where this fits. I'm satisfied that the issue stems from an access-related permission issue or app-related limitation within Outlook.\n\n\n"
