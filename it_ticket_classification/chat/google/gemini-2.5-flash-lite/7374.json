I'm leaning towards a specific category based on the mention of equipment, but I'm also considering the context of someone leaving.\n\n**Classifying IT Requests**\n\nI'm currently evaluating the ticket, and the mention of \"equipment,\" \"display,\" \"mouse,\" and \"headset\" points strongly towards a **Hardware** classification. While \"last day\" and \"leaving\" hint at HR, the actionable item is the management of physical items.\n\n**Processing Ticket Information**\n\nI'm now focusing on discerning the primary intent behind the IT ticket. The explicit mentions of \"equipment,\" \"display,\" \"mouse,\" and \"headset\" are strong indicators for a **Hardware** classification, even though the context of \"leaving\" suggests an HR element. My current direction is to prioritize the tangible IT assets involved.\n\n**Identifying IT Ticket Focus**\n\nI'm currently analyzing the ticket to pinpoint its core purpose. The detailed enumeration of \"equipment,\" \"display,\" \"mouse,\" and \"headset\" strongly suggests a **Hardware** classification. While the mention of \"last day\" and \"leaving\" provides context, the actionable items revolve around tangible IT assets.\n\n**Processing Ticket Data**\n\nI'm currently analyzing the IT ticket, and the explicit mentions of \"equipment,\" \"display,\" \"mouse,\" and \"headset\" strongly indicate a **Hardware** classification.
