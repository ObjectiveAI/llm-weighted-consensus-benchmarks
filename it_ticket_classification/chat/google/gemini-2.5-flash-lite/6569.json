The text indicates mentions of \"azure\" and \"cloud,\" alongside a \"hybrid hosting platform.\" I'm carefully analyzing these keywords, along with the other options, to determine if they accurately align with any of the predetermined categories like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" My goal is to select the category that best encapsulates the underlying issue described.\n\n\n**Defining Ticket Context**\n\nI've been meticulously examining the recent text to determine the core IT ticket classification. I'm leaning towards \"Internal Project\" now, as the description involves a strategic shift to Azure, reshaping business offerings, and enabling customers to adopt a new hybrid platform. The discussion of legacy infrastructure and a move to the cloud further solidifies this direction. I'm actively comparing this option against \"Miscellaneous,\" which I'll only resort to if nothing more specific surfaces.\n\n\n**Evaluating Project Scope**\n\nThe text continues to emphasize the strategic nature of the change. I'm focusing on the implementation's broader implications to narrow down the ticket type. I'm prioritizing \"Internal Project\" due to the core theme of reshaping business offerings and moving away from legacy infrastructure through Azure. While the purchase of Azure services is implied, the central focus is clearly on the strategic project itself and the customer-facing platform shift. The description of this project makes a case for \"Internal Project.\"\n\n\n"
