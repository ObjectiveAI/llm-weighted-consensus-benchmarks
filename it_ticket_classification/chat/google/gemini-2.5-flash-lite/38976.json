My focus is to determine the most fitting category from the options: \"Hardware|HR Support|Access|Miscellaneous|Storage|Purchase|Internal Project|Administrative rights\". Based on the repeated mention of login issues and password changes, I'm leaning toward \"Access\" being the most appropriate classification. However, I'm still considering if it might overlap with \"Administrative rights\", as password resets could imply administrative tasks. I need to clarify if \"Access\" encompasses these.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've just finished analyzing the ticket, now including \"also kind regards engineer en,\" which doesn't alter my assessment. Considering \"logging in,\" \"changed password,\" and \"reset password,\" the core issue clearly centers around user access. My initial inclination towards \"Access\" is reinforced; it's the most fitting category, encompassing the user's login difficulties. \"Administrative rights\" is irrelevant here.\n\n\n"
