I'm leaning toward \"Internal Project\" as the closest fit, but I need to consider all the possibilities. There are potential implications if it is also a data-access issue.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Ticket**\n\nI've zeroed in on the \"Internal Project\" category as the most fitting. The phrase \"wrong grade setup for on project\" is highly suggestive of an internal process error within a project context. However, I'm still keeping HR Support in mind as a potential secondary classification, just to cover all bases, as the term \"grade\" could imply an HR-related system. I'm building out a list to make a final decision.\n\n\n**Narrowing the Focus**\n\nI'm now completely fixated on the \"Internal Project\" classification. The phrases \"assignment code\" and \"on project\" are too specific to ignore. I've re-read the ticket, and the HR angle feels less likely than it did earlier. The context strongly points to a system or process error within a project framework.\n\n\n"
