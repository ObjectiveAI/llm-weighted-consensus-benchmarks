I need to clarify the context.\n\n\n**Defining Ticket Assignment**\n\nI've honed in on \"Access\" as the fitting category for this ticket, and I think that it's crucial I continue to explore how to improve this classification. The keywords point overwhelmingly towards issues linked to card access. I must ensure the analysis is clear, and the chosen category is the only logical conclusion.\n\n\n"
