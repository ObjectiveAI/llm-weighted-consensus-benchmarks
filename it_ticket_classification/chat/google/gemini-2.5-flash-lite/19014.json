I'm carefully examining the keywords to see if there are nuances to consider, before I confidently assign the ticket to Hardware, HR Support or Access. I've ruled out Access, and am weighing Hardware against HR Support.\n\n\n**Assigning Ticket Category**\n\nI've determined that the ticket content points unequivocally to a Hardware issue. The phrases \"new mouse request,\" \"replacement mouse,\" and \"mouse provided\" solidify this conclusion. While \"Purchase\" could be considered tangentially, the core focus is on the hardware itself. The other categories, HR, Access, Storage, Miscellaneous, Internal Project, and Administrative rights, are not relevant to the ticket's description.\n\n\n**Finalizing Ticket Assignment**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's content, focusing on keywords and phrases. Analyzing \"new mouse request,\" \"replacement mouse,\" and \"mouse provided\" confirms a hardware issue. While \"Purchase\" is a possibility, \"Hardware\" is more accurate. The other categories are irrelevant. Therefore, I confidently assign this ticket to \"Hardware.\"\n\n\n"
