I've noted key phrases like \"new starter access card\" and \"work location required hardware.\" The presence of \"enabling\" and \"resolve\" suggest an action is required. I need to carefully weigh the category options, considering the combination of access, hardware, and onboarding-related elements. I'm leaning toward a category related to new employee setup or access management, but further analysis is needed to select the best fit.\n\n\n**Prioritizing HR Relevance**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's language, especially \"new starter access card,\" \"work location required hardware,\" and \"starter form.\" These terms point strongly towards an onboarding process. While \"Access\" and \"Hardware\" are relevant, \"HR Support\" appears to be the most inclusive category, effectively capturing the core intent of the ticket. I am now certain in my selection.\n\n\n"
