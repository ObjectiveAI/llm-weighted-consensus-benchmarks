The ticket text strongly points to issues related to a switch device. The description explicitly mentions \"switch device issues\" and its function in connecting terminals. This aligns well with the \"Hardware\" category. I am still reviewing the other options to ensure this is the best fit, but \"Hardware\" seems the clear frontrunner.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Issue**\n\nThe analysis points decisively towards \"Hardware\" as the correct categorization. The ticket's focus on a malfunctioning switch, its physical role in connections, and the need for replacement all strongly suggest a hardware problem. I am confident in this classification, given the evidence and my understanding of the permitted categories. No further adjustments seem necessary.\n\n\n"
