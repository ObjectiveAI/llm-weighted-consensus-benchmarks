I'm focusing on \"site creation\", \"permissions\", and \"group management\", specifically for \"leads\" and \"owners\" in a context suggesting a \"bid vault\" or \"library.\" Identifying these key functions is vital for proper categorization.\n\n\n**Defining Key Actions**\n\nI've refined the core actions down to site creation, access control (permissions & AD groups), and content management, possibly tied to bids or a library. I'm noting specific terms like \"bid vault area,\" \"repository,\" and \"Confluence\" to understand the context. The crucial aspect now is selecting the most appropriate category or categories, considering the \"create site\", \"permissions\", and \"ad groups\" components.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Ticket Classification**\n\nCurrently, I'm focusing on the \"Access\" category, seeing it as the most direct fit given the strong emphasis on \"permissions,\" \"AD groups,\" and user roles. I've ruled out \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Purchase,\" and \"Miscellaneous\". I'm considering \"Storage\" cautiously if the site's primary purpose is data storage. \"Internal Project\" is a possible secondary consideration if \"Access\" doesn't cover the full scope, but I'm leaning toward the technical access aspect as the core.\n\n\n"
