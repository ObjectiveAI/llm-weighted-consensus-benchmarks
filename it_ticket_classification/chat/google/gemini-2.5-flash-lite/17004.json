I've noted keywords like \"maternity leave\" and \"access card,\" which suggest potential areas. I'm leaning toward combining \"HR Support\" for the maternity leave and \"Access\" for the card deactivation request. The phrase \"leave\" is the only thing that's currently ambiguous. I'm exploring how these categories fit based on the complete text.\n\n\n**Analyzing Ticket Details**\n\nI've re-evaluated the category options, and HR Support and Access are now my primary contenders. The ticket's origin from a \"leaver form\" makes \"HR Support\" a strong fit, as it encapsulates the broader context of the request. \"Access\" is still relevant for the card deactivation, but \"HR Support\" seems more encompassing and therefore the better primary label.\n\n\n**Defining the Ticket's Scope**\n\nI'm now fully committed to \"HR Support\" as the most appropriate category. The \"maternity leaver form\" clearly signifies an HR-driven process. While \"Access\" is relevant for the card deactivation, \"HR Support\" encapsulates the root cause and broader context of the ticket, making it the superior choice.\n\n\n"
