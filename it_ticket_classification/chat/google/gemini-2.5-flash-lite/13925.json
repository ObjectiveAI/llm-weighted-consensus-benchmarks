This points me strongly toward the \"Access\" category. While \"Miscellaneous\" is a possibility, the specific mention of planning access makes \"Access\" the more probable choice. I'm focusing on the keywords related to permissions and availability.\n\n\n**Defining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the \"Access\" category as the most probable fit. The user's request, focusing on planning access and rotation management, strongly aligns with needing access to a resource. While \"Miscellaneous\" is always a possibility, the specific mention of access to \"planning\" resources makes \"Access\" the better choice. I'm focusing on keywords like permissions and availability, as the user clearly needs to be granted access.\n\n\n**Determining Best Fit**\n\nMy analysis indicates the ticket falls under \"Access\". The core request is clearly about gaining access to planning resources and rotation management features. The phrase \"wants to access planning\" is the central concern, aligning directly with the \"Access\" category. While aspects like documentation and workflow are implied, they are secondary to the primary need for access.\n\n\n"
