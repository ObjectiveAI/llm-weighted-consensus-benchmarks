Initial assessment suggests it relates to access, specifically adding people to a communication group. I'm leaning toward \"Access\" but want to confirm this is the most fitting. I'm re-reading the ticket text to make sure there are not any contextual clues I am missing. My current priority is to make the correct association between the ticket and the provided categories.\n\n\n**Revising Category Choice**\n\nAfter further review, I've confirmed that \"Access\" is indeed the most accurate category. Adding individuals to a communication group aligns directly with the concept of granting access to resources and channels. While \"Internal Project\" could be a secondary consideration, the primary action requested, adding people, strongly suggests \"Access\" as the primary categorization. The repeated phrase \"add people\" solidified this determination.\n\n\n**Pinpointing Access Type**\n\nI'm now diving deeper into the nuances of this \"Access\" ticket, specifically the kind of access being requested. The repetitive nature of \"add people\" confirms the core action, but I'm considering whether it implies a specific type of access, like read-only, edit, or full control, to that communication group. I'm focusing on the implied permissions the group grants.\n\n\n"
