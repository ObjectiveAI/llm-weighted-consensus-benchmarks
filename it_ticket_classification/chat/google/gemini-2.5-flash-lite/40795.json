After analyzing the text, which mentions time card issues, I'm leaning toward selecting \"HR Support\" as the appropriate category. The phrases \"time cards\", \"submission\", and \"records error\" all point to payroll-related functions, which often fall under HR's purview. I'm confident that this is the best fit.\n\n\n**Defining the Core Issue**\n\nI've refined my thinking by carefully evaluating the provided categories against the ticket content. The initial instinct to select \"HR Support\" has been solidified by further examination. The keywords all point decisively towards an HR-related issue. The mentions of \"time cards\", \"submission error\", and \"records\" strongly support this conclusion. After comparing the ticket with the other choices, this choice seems the obvious one.\n\n\n"
