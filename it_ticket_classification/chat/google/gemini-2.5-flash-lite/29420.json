The ticket text's mention of a \"maternity leaver form\" and a generic \"pm\" adds another dimension to consider. Given the options, I'm leaning toward two potential labels, though I'm still weighing the nuance between them carefully. I'm focusing on the \"access card\" mention as the final clue.\n\n\n**Finalizing Category Selection**\n\nI've determined that \"HR Support\" is the most fitting category. While the \"access card\" did cause me to pause, the dominant clue was the \"maternity leaver form.\" That, along with the context of a departing employee, clearly points to HR's procedures and processes as the crux of this ticket. I'm now confident in this assignment.\n\n\n**Defining Ticket Focus**\n\nI've carefully analyzed the ticket text: \"maternity leaver form\", \"access card\", and \"pm.\" While \"access card\" raised a slight possibility of \"Access,\" the central theme is an employee's departure. This points strongly toward HR, and I'm now certain that \"HR Support\" best captures the essence of this ticket. I'm moving forward with this classification.\n\n\n"
