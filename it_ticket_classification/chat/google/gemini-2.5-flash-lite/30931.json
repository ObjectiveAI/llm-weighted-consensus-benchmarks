The keywords \"oracle fusion,\" \"multiple entries,\" \"sheet,\" \"rows,\" and \"approve\" are giving me some leads. I'm leaning toward either HR Support or Internal Project, given the connection to Oracle Fusion and the potential for an internal workflow related to data entry or approvals. I'm still weighing the best fit, but I'm making progress.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Category Refinement**\n\nMy focus has shifted to refining the category. The \"multiple entries\" and \"approve\" hints strongly suggest HR Support, given the Oracle Fusion context. I've ruled out Hardware, Storage, Purchase, and Administrative Rights. The ticket's description of duplicated entries in a sheet within Oracle Fusion cements my preference for HR Support, as it's common in data processing. Internal Project could be a fallback, but HR Support is the leading contender for now.\n\n\n**Defining Ticket Classification**\n\nMy assessment strongly points toward HR Support as the most appropriate category for this ticket. The \"Oracle Fusion\" context combined with \"multiple entries\" and the reference to \"sheet\" and \"approve\" creates a convincing case. This combination signals a data-related issue, probably involving employee information, within an HR system. The phrases point heavily toward a standard data management or workflow issue typical in HR departments.\n\n\n"
