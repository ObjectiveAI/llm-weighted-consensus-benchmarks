My focus is on determining how to map the content to the predefined categories. I've begun with the phrase \"reset password.\"\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've been drilling down on the ticket content. The repeated theme of password resets, expiry, and access, along with the detailed steps for password resets, strongly indicates \"Access\". Even though \"order change\" is present, it's secondary and less frequent. I'm prioritizing the main recurring topic.\n\n\n**Defining the Category:**\n\nI've carefully reviewed the ticket content again. The repeated instances of \"reset password,\" \"expire days,\" and \"access\" firmly place the focus on access management. I've discounted \"order change\" as it's secondary to the core access issue. The steps detailed in the ticket regarding \"ctrl alt delete,\" \"logging,\" and \"gear icon\" support the 'Access' classification. I am confident in my determination.\n\n\n"
