After carefully reviewing the provided text, I'm leaning towards a \"Hardware\" or \"Access\" issue, given the mention of connection problems and potential physical checks. I'll need to analyze further to decide which is more appropriate or if a different category fits better.\n\n\n**Defining the Root Cause**\n\nThe ticket text analysis has concluded that the issue is likely rooted in a hardware or network problem within the meeting room, likely related to cable connectivity. I'm prioritizing \"Hardware\" as the primary category, with \"Access\" as a potential secondary classification pending further investigation. The text explicitly mentions checking the cable connection, solidifying this conclusion.\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nMy analysis now firmly points to \"Hardware\" as the definitive category for this IT ticket. The \"meeting room\" context coupled with the explicit mention of \"cable connection\" solidified this. While \"Access\" was a contender, the primary focus is on the hardware's connectivity issues, making \"Hardware\" the most accurate classification. I'm satisfied this category accurately reflects the problem's nature.\n\n\n"
