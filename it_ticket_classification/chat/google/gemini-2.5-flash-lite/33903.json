Initial keywords like \"board\" and \"interns\" are under scrutiny. The time-sensitive nature (\"Tuesday July\") has piqued my interest. I'm aiming to differentiate between the potential implications: is this an access request, a project-related task, or perhaps something else entirely? A full read is required.\n\n\n**Categorizing Access Issues**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on Access. The \"rights\" mentions are clear indicators. \"Board\" suggests a controlled environment, likely requiring access. The recurring theme of interns further supports this. I'm discarding Hardware, HR, Storage, and Purchase as irrelevant. Miscellaneous remains a fallback, but Access is the most precise fit for now.\n\n\n**Determining Ticket Priority**\n\nI'm now prioritizing the ticket based on the content. The recurring mentions of \"rights\" are the primary focus. While \"interns\" is relevant, I believe the core issue is granting access. \"Board\" may refer to a system/team needing these rights. \"Miscellaneous\" seems too vague, and the other categories aren't relevant. I'm leaning toward Access as the most accurate classification.\n\n\n"
