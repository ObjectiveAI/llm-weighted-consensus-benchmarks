Further assessment is underway.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Options**\n\nI've re-evaluated the \"Hardware\" category, but the core issue clearly centers on *communication*. This leans us away from physical device problems. \"Access\" still looks to be the strongest contender given the nature of the issue. I've ruled out \"HR Support\", \"Storage\", \"Purchase\" and \"Internal Project\" as they're not related to the core issue.\n\n\n**Finalizing Category Selection**\n\nI'm now fully confident in \"Access\" as the correct category. The issue of only external calls failing, when internal ones succeed, firmly points toward a connectivity or permission problem. The focus on calling, rather than device functionality, makes \"Hardware\" irrelevant. The other categories, like \"HR Support,\" are completely inapplicable. \"Access\" is the most direct and accurate label for this issue.\n\n\n"
