My immediate task is to accurately map its details to the most appropriate category from the provided list. This ticket specifically mentions \"video surveillance is working and\" so I'm focusing on how that fits into hardware, access, or perhaps a more general miscellaneous classification for now.\n\n**Mapping Ticket Details**\n\nI'm diligently working to assign the IT ticket to its correct category. The mention of \"video surveillance is working and recording\" strongly suggests a connection to hardware components, while the phrase \"store recorded videos\" points directly to storage requirements. I'm weighing these against the other available options.\n\n**Storing Surveillance Recordings**\n\nI'm continuing my analysis, focusing on the core need expressed in the ticket: \"store recorded videos.\" This strongly points towards the \"Storage\" category. While video surveillance itself involves hardware, the current phrasing emphasizes the management and retention of the recorded data.\n\n**Storing Surveillance Footage**\n\nI'm prioritizing the categorization of the IT ticket, focusing on the explicit mention of \"store recorded videos.\" This strongly aligns with the \"Storage\" category, as the primary expressed need revolves around data retention and management of surveillance footage.\n\n**Focusing on Storage Needs**\n\nI'm continuing my analysis of the IT ticket, specifically zeroing in on the explicit mention of \"store recorded videos.\" This phrase strongly indicates that the primary concern revolves around data retention capabilities, leading me to prioritize the \"Storage\" category.\n\n"
