Keywords like \"add user\" point to account management. Further breakdown shows it involves connecting mobile devices. The key purpose is unclear. Additional details are needed to properly categorize it. I'm focusing on \"add user\" and \"mobile devices\" as core elements.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Ticket Classification**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the best category for this ticket. The \"adding user\" and \"connect mobile devices\" aspects strongly suggest **Access**, but I'm keeping Hardware in mind, given the devices. I'm focusing on \"adding user\" and \"connect\" to hone in on the core request.\n\n\n**Pinpointing Access Concerns**\n\nI'm now prioritizing the \"adding user\" element. I've re-evaluated \"connect mobile devices\" within the context of access control. My thinking has evolved to focus on granting the user the ability to connect. It seems the user request is related to device access, but not necessarily about the device itself.\n\n\n**Refining Access Classification**\n\nI'm now prioritizing the \"adding user\" part of the request. The user needs the ability to connect several devices. \"Tuesday user\" hints at a specific role. I've re-evaluated \"connect mobile devices\" within the context of access control. It seems the user request relates more to device access for a new account, not the devices themselves.\n\n\n"
