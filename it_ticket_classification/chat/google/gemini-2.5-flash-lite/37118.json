I'm leaning heavily towards \"Access\" or \"Hardware\" due to the technical nature of the issue. I'm exploring the context further to make a definitive choice, and will update my thought process shortly.\n\n\n**Evaluating Storage Concerns**\n\nI've shifted focus to \"Storage\" as the primary categorization. The phrase \"not enough space for upgrade\" is a clear indicator, and aligns perfectly. I've re-evaluated \"Hardware\" and \"Access\" considering the context. Reinstalling or repairing the system, because of a lack of storage, feels like a secondary issue. I'm confident now.\n\n\n**Finalizing Storage Decision**\n\nI'm now fully committed to \"Storage\". The evidence is overwhelming: the issue stems directly from insufficient disk space, preventing the upgrade and necessitating reinstallation. While \"installers missing\" hinted at software, the root cause is the lack of storage. I've re-evaluated \"Hardware,\" but the problem isn't a physical malfunction. The ticket's core is the storage constraint, which impacts the upgrade and the software installation attempts.\n\n\n"
