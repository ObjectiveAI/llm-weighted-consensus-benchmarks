The text contains specific keywords, which are key for my classification. My goal is to determine if the ticket relates to access rights or possibly an HR-related issue. Based on the phrases, my working hypothesis is \"Access\", though \"HR Support\" seems like a possibility as well. Further analysis of this particular ticket is ongoing.\n\n\n**Narrowing Category Determination**\n\nI've decided to refine the category to \"Access.\" Key phrases mentioning queues and systems solidified this conclusion. The text focuses on granting access, which aligns best with this choice from the available options. My analysis shows a strong correlation between the ticket content and the \"Access\" category, leading me to believe I have the right category.\n\n\n"
