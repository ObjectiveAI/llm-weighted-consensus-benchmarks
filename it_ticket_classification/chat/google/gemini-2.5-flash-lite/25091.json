After analyzing the provided content, which discusses monitors and Macs, I'm leaning heavily towards placing it under \"Hardware.\" The mention of \"monitor types\" further reinforces this. I'll need to double-check that this is the best fit, but it seems like a clear hardware-related request.\n\n\n**Defining the Ticket Type**\n\nI've refined my thinking on the IT ticket categorization. While \"Purchase\" was a contender, the primary focus seems to be hardware-related questions about monitors and Macs. Given that the user is seeking info on monitor types and brands, \"Hardware\" is the most encompassing and accurate classification. My decision rests firmly on the ticket's core content, making it a clear fit for the \"Hardware\" category.\n\n\n"
