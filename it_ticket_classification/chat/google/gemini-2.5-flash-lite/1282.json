The words \"order\" and \"location\" are hinting towards \"Purchase\", but \"staff addition\" and \"solve\" are less clear. I'm considering all categories to find the best fit. I'm focusing on keywords and their relation to the available options.\n\n\n**Pinpointing Access Needs**\n\nI'm now leaning heavily towards \"Access\" as the correct category. The phrase \"addition to all staff\" strongly points toward granting some level of permission or access. While \"order\" might still suggest a \"Purchase,\" the primary focus seems to be granting access to new or existing staff. I'm still considering all factors, but I'm focusing my analysis to see if any other categories fit.\n\n\n**Confirming Access Focus**\n\nI've decided to refine the analysis and am now mostly settled on the \"Access\" category. The phrase \"addition to all staff\" sealed the deal, implying a need to grant permission. While other keywords were ambiguous, the core request is undoubtedly about granting access to something. I've successfully isolated the key phrase and confirmed its relevance to the available options. The initial confusion has largely cleared up, and I'm ready to mark this ticket as \"Access\".\n\n\n**Selecting Correct Classification**\n\nI've decided on \"Access\" for this ticket's category. The key phrase, \"addition to all staff,\" firmly points toward granting some kind of access, whether to systems, software, or resources. While other words were unclear, the core request is undoubtedly about granting access. This determination is made after careful evaluation of all options.\n\n\n"
