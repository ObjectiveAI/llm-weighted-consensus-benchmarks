After analyzing the keywords, \"leaver form\" and \"leave,\" I'm leaning towards \"HR Support.\" The mention of a \"location\" could potentially involve access, but the primary function seems HR-related. I will verify if there are any further contextual signals that would influence my choice.\n\n\n**Narrowing the Focus**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the best category. \"Leaver\" and \"leave\" are repeatedly used, which, coupled with \"leaver form,\" steers me definitively toward \"HR Support.\" There's no clear hardware or storage component, and \"access\" seems incidental to the primary request. I am still reviewing the context to make absolutely sure.\n\n\n**Re-evaluating the Options**\n\nI'm now re-evaluating the best fit, weighing the primary focus. While \"Access\" is present due to account deactivation, the overarching theme is the employee's departure and associated processes, strongly pointing to \"HR Support.\" There is also hardware involved, but that also is secondary to the HR process. I'm focusing on the primary intent.\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the keywords and context within the IT ticket. I've concluded that the \"leaver\" process is definitely the central theme. While access management and hardware are touched upon, they are subsidiary to the HR-related task of handling an employee's departure.\n\n\n"
