Keywords like \"new starter\" and \"joining\" strongly suggest an HR-related issue. My goal is to pinpoint the most accurate category. It looks like \"HR Support\" is the most likely candidate, but I need to be certain. I'm carefully reviewing the context to make a final decision, avoiding presumptions.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Best Fit**\n\nI'm now fully confident \"HR Support\" is the right category. The terms \"new starter\" and \"joining\" are definitive, pointing to the onboarding process managed by HR. While access might be a component, it's a consequence of the HR process, not the primary focus of this request. Thus, \"HR Support\" is a more fitting initial designation for this IT ticket.\n\n\n"
