I'm exploring the nuances of similar keywords.\n\n\n**Identifying HR Relevance**\n\nI've been drilling down on the text of the IT ticket. I'm focusing on keywords like \"annual leave\", \"contractor\", and \"timecards\". The context suggests an HR-related issue with leave requests and contractor management. I'm confident that this ticket falls squarely within the \"HR Support\" category, given the nature of the requests.\n\n\n"
