My focus is on interpreting phrases like \"server not server room\" and \"workstation sitting under table\" to pinpoint whether it relates to hardware issues, access problems, or another category.\n\n**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm currently refining my categorization by considering the interplay of hardware and physical location within the ticket's description. The mention of a workstation acting as a server and its placement, along with decommissioning plans, strongly points towards a \"Hardware\" classification.\n\n**Focusing on Hardware**\n\nI'm currently consolidating my analysis, confirming that the core of this ticket revolves around a physical workstation's unconventional role and its location, leading me to definitively select \"Hardware\" as the most fitting category.\n\n"
