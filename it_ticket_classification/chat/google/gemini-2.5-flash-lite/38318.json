The text about a \"new starter template issue\" and \"license\" hints strongly towards \"Access\" being the relevant category. Although a purchase of a new license might be considered, the problem seems to be an access issue. I am choosing \"Access.\"\n\n\n**Analyzing the Onboarding Issue**\n\nI've been evaluating the onboarding issue in detail. While the presence of \"license\" did initially suggest \"Access,\" I'm now leaning heavily towards \"HR Support.\" The \"new starter template\" and \"creating starter\" phrases strongly point to HR's involvement. The license aspect seems secondary to the core process problem. I'm focusing on the procedural aspect. The repeated attempts indicate a systemic glitch more aligned with the HR onboarding pipeline than a simple access grant.\n\n\n**Pinpointing HR Alignment**\n\nI'm now fully immersed in the \"new starter template\" issue, solidifying my choice of \"HR Support.\" The phrasing about \"multiple times work\" indicates a workflow problem, not just a one-off access denial. The license aspect seems ancillary to the primary onboarding procedural glitch. I'm choosing \"HR Support\" because of the strong connection between onboarding and human resources.\n\n\n"
