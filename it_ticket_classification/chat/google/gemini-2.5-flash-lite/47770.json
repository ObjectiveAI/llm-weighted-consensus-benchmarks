Right now, I'm working through how to accurately map phrases like \"expense report submission\" and \"submitting expense report\" to the most appropriate category within the given schema. I'm leaning toward \"HR Support\" for these, but I'm considering possible overlaps with \"Purchase\" if there's an associated system or process.\n\n\n**Revising Category Assignment**\n\nI've revised the categorization. The ticket, mentioning \"expense report submission,\" \"imaged receipts,\" and an \"error message,\" now leans strongly toward \"HR Support.\" It's less about hardware or storage and more about the employee's process of submitting expenses, and possibly a related system error. While \"Access\" could be relevant, the main problem centers on the report itself, so \"HR Support\" remains the most precise fit.\n\n\n**Pinpointing Primary Issue**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the primary issue. After careful review, I've confirmed the \"HR Support\" categorization. The ticket clearly centers on an expense report submission. The attached image and error message, potentially related to policy or system access, further solidify the HR connection. The phrase \"organization classified expenditure senior manager\" supports this, suggesting the issue is tied to company policy or the reporting system itself.\n\n\n"
