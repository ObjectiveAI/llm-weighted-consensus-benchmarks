The phrase \"new job title\" suggests an HR-related inquiry, perhaps related to a change in role. Other keywords seem less relevant, however.\n\n\n**Refining Categorization Strategy**\n\nI've been evaluating the ticket text again, and \"HR Support\" still feels like the strongest fit. The phrase \"new job title\" is a direct indicator. While \"Oracle job title\" could hint at access, the primary concern seems to be the role change itself. I'm focusing on the core meaning, and I'm discarding any potential categories I previously considered less relevant, like \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Storage.\"\n\n\n**Focusing on Core Issue**\n\nI've been analyzing the text again. My thinking now centers on the core issue: the \"new job title.\" While the \"Oracle\" aspect is present, the primary focus seems to be updating employee data, which leans heavily towards HR. \"Product specialist\" and \"senior engineer\" further clarify the nature of the role change, but they don't change the fundamental HR-related nature of the request. Therefore, I am settling on HR Support as the most appropriate category.\n\n\n"
