The ticket text strongly suggests an access-related issue, specifically the need to view leave information. I'm leaning toward \"Access\" as the most suitable category.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the ticket text and it's increasingly clear that \"HR Support\" is the most accurate classification. While \"access\" is mentioned, the core requirement is obtaining employee absence and leave information. The user's goal is to understand leave statuses, which is squarely within the realm of HR-related support. This aligns more directly with the intent than simply gaining access to the report.\n\n\n"
