The provided text, \"obi new report obi report hello report within,\" is challenging because it's so concise. I'm carefully reviewing each keyword, trying to identify any potential clues. My goal is to select the most accurate category from the given list: \"Hardware|HR Support|Access|Miscellaneous|Storage|Purchase|Internal Project|Administrative rights.\" Given the focus on \"report,\" I'm leaning toward \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project,\" but I want to be certain before making a final decision.\n\n\n**Defining Report Requirements**\n\nI've made significant progress in defining the report requirements. Analyzing the ticket content, which includes, \"obi new report obi report hello report within  obi logic allow recruiters track own candidates,\" is key.

I\u2019m giving serious thought to what this project actually entails.\n\n\n**Determining Project Classification**\n\nI'm deep in the process of classifying the ticket, considering all the options and the complex request for a new report with specific functionalities. \"Internal Project\" is still the leading contender as the ticket outlines modification to an existing report, including dashboard changes. The core idea is to improve internal systems for recruiter performance. I'm focusing on whether this is more of an operational adjustment (perhaps \"Miscellaneous\") or a clear feature development initiative. Considering all of these points, I am certain this is a new internal project.\n\n\n**Determining Report Design**\n\nI'm now fully immersed in the nuances of this ticket, focusing on the specific features of the requested report, and considering where this fits most logically. The current focus is \"obi new report\" and dashboard modifications, related to recruiter candidate tracking.
