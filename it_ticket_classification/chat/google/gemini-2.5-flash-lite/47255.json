I am specifically investigating how to distinguish between access issues and broader application problems, such as the Confluence export error. I am aiming to use keywords and context to ensure accurate categorization.\n\n\n**Analyzing Ticket Text**\n\nI've determined the key problem is access. The phrases \"not working,\" \"cannot access,\" and \"cannot export\" all point towards accessibility. While other categories might be tangentially relevant, \"Access\" directly addresses the user's primary concern.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Root Issue**\n\nMy analysis indicates that the 'Access' category is the most appropriate. The recurring issue centers on inability to use the application, regardless of the attempted function or user group. While \"Internal Project\" is a possible side choice due to the service being used for team work, the users want to be able to use the service, which is a matter of access.\n\n\n"
