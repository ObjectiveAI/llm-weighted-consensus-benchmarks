I'm currently parsing the text \"submit missing time sheet for leaver\" and considering the available categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, Administrative rights. My initial thought is to lean towards \"HR Support\" due to the mention of a \"time sheet\" and a \"leaver,\" but I'm keeping my mind open.\n\n\n**Revisiting Category Assignment**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket's text, now considering additional phrasings like \"submit leaver timecards\" and \"filling leaver timecards responsibility.\" These further solidify my conclusion. \"HR Support\" remains the most appropriate category, given the nature of managing time records tied to departing employees. This aligns well with the core issues of \"leavers\" and their associated \"time sheets.\" The other categories just don't have a direct connection.\n\n\n"
