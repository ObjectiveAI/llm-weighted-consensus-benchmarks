I'm isolating these instructions to build the classification and understand the urgency from the user.\n\n\n**Identifying Ticket Intent**\n\nI've analyzed the ticket content: \"notifications template to be amended snow march template amended snow hi please amend by include name which raised apply accounts thanks.\" My main focus is on the template modification request. Keywords like \"amend,\" \"include name,\" and \"apply accounts\" are clear. I'm carefully evaluating the provided categories to determine the most relevant one for this specific modification request.\n\n\n**Classifying the Ticket**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's intent: to modify a notification template related to account applications, specifically to include the requester's name. Keywords like \"amend template,\" \"include name,\" and \"apply accounts\" are central. Initially, I thought \"Miscellaneous\" was the best fit, but upon reflection, \"Access\" might be more accurate if the template governs notifications for account-related changes. The function, and intent of these notifications is related to Access, even if the template is not directly granting access itself. I'm leaning towards \"Access,\" but I'm still weighing this against the broader \"Miscellaneous\" category.\n\n\n**Refining Ticket Categorization**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the \"Access\" and \"Miscellaneous\" categories. The template's link to account applications makes \"Access\" more compelling. Keywords such as \"apply accounts\" and the notification context are key. I'm focusing on \"amend template\" as the action, and the notifications around accounts access.\n\n\n**Selecting the Best Fit**\n\nI'm now fully immersed in the ticket's categorization. The core of the request is still the template modification, but its context is crucial. Considering \"apply accounts,\" I'm leaning strongly towards \"Access,\" as this template likely relates to account management. While \"Miscellaneous\" is a fallback, the connection to account actions makes \"Access\" more appropriate.\n\n\n"
