I'm leaning toward \"HR Support\" but will consider other angles.  I'm trying to decide if the problem warrants escalation.\n\n\n**Defining the Core Issue**\n\nI've honed in on the HR Support classification. The timecard error details, along with mentions of logging work and related system functions, solidified this as the correct path. It's not a hardware or access issue, and it's far too specific for \"Miscellaneous.\" The language strongly suggests a problem within an HR-managed system. I'm now certain HR support is the correct category, so let's get this ticket routed to the right team!\n\n\n"
