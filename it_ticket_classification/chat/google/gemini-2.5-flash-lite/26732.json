The \"internal audit admin accounts\" combined with \"password set to never expire\" strongly suggests an Administrative Rights or Access concern. While related to security, I think Administrative Rights is the best fit. I'm leaning toward that classification as the primary focus seems to be the management of these accounts and their permissions, not just access control.\n\n\n**Re-evaluating the Category**\n\nI'm reconsidering the initial category. While \"Administrative Rights\" still seems relevant, the \"access\" aspect is undeniable, given the nature of admin accounts. The ticket details point to a need for access control and policy application, specifically for these privileged accounts. I think \"Access\" might be a better fit, incorporating the administrative element. The \"internal audit\" detail makes me think it could be an \"Internal Project\". I am now weighing all 3: Access, Administrative Rights, and Internal Project.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Core Issue**\n\nI've decided to refine the category choice. While \"Administrative Rights\" initially seemed most fitting, the user's focus on \"internal audit admin accounts\" and associated policy suggests the broader context of an \"Internal Project\". The \"access\" aspect is still implicit, but the primary task seems to be the configuration and management of these admin accounts as part of a larger, internal initiative. This leads me to believe the most pertinent category should be \"Internal Project\" encompassing both Administrative Rights and Access as sub-components.\n\n\n"
