Terms like \"purchase\" and \"allocation\" are quite prominent, which leads me to lean toward \"Purchase.\" However, I need to ensure this is the most accurate, given the other possibilities. I am now double-checking.\n\n\n**Categorizing Ticket Successfully**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's text, identifying key terms like \"po\" and \"purchase,\" and have now firmly placed the ticket under the \"Purchase\" category. The repeated use of these terms makes it a clear choice. I've also eliminated other possibilities by reviewing the keywords against other potential categories, confirming my earlier conclusion.\n\n\n**Refining Category Selection**\n\nI'm now carefully examining the ticket's keywords again. \"PO\" and \"purchase\" are dominant, but I considered installation for \"Hardware\".  However, after deeper analysis, the context suggests this is about a purchase requiring installation, not a dedicated hardware request. \"Administrator\" is also a consideration, but the primary request is still purchase-related. The phrase \"allocation po\" hints at purchasing as well. Ultimately, \"Purchase\" is the most accurate.\n\n\n"
