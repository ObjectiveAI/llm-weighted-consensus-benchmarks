The text references \"time card,\" \"oracle,\" and \"annual leave dates,\" which points toward an HR-related system or access. I'm leaning toward \"HR Support\" at this point, but I'm keeping an open mind for other possibilities such as \"Access,\" as the references could mean the user has access issues, or \"Miscellaneous\".\n\n\n**Confirming Category Choice**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket details, now with the categories in mind, and the \"HR Support\" label seems most fitting. While access could be a factor, the phrases \"time card,\" \"cards for approval,\" and \"annual leave dates\" suggest the user is unable to submit time card, indicating a functional issue with the HR system or an HR process more so than a simple access issue. My decision is increasingly solidifying around this selection.\n\n\n"
