Identifying \"faulty laptop\" strongly suggests a hardware concern. My focus now is ensuring the chosen category aligns perfectly with the user's needs.\n\n\n**Analyzing Ticket Content**\n\nI've carefully analyzed the ticket text, and now I'm leaning heavily towards the \"Hardware\" category, due to the consistent mentions of hardware failures like \"faulty laptop\", \"motherboard problems\", and \"freezing\". The \"extended battery\" suggestion also raises the possibility of classifying this ticket with the \"Purchase\" category, but the core issue appears to be hardware-related.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Hardware Issues**\n\nI've determined that \"Hardware\" is the most fitting category, based on the prevalent hardware-related concerns like \"faulty laptop\", \"motherboard problems\", and constant \"freezing.\" While the user inquired about an \"extended battery\", the core complaint centers around a faulty device and its symptoms. I believe the purchase request is secondary.\n\n\n**Confirming Hardware Priority**\n\nI'm now fully committed to \"Hardware\" as the central category. The ticket's pervasive focus on the laptop's malfunctioning motherboard and its constant freezing solidifies this. While there is a battery purchase request, this seems secondary to the core issue of a faulty device. I'm satisfied this accurately reflects the user's primary concern.\n\n\n"
