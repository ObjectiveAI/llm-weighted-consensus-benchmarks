                    "reasoning": "**Classifying this ticket**\n\nI'm currently focused on categorizing this IT ticket. After analyzing the text, I'm leaning towards a few possibilities. The phrases like \"stopped working\" and \"previously able to use\" suggest a functional issue, but I'm trying to decide if it's more general (\"Miscellaneous\") or possibly related to \"Purchase\" since it's about an \"expense items spreadsheet\". I'll consider the available categories to make the best call.\n\n\n**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the correct IT ticket category. After analyzing the phrases, I'm confident it's a software/functionality issue. Given the options, \"Miscellaneous\" feels too broad, and \"Purchase\" isn't a perfect fit. I'm focusing now on whether the problem is due to a lack of \"Administrative rights\" since the user is an \"administrator\", or if the problem is more general. I'll need to consider how these categories apply to a function within a spreadsheet.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Culprit**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and it seems the central issue is with the spreadsheet function. While the \"administrator\" label gave me pause, I'm leaning away from \"Administrative rights\" as the primary cause. After all, the problem is with a specific \"function\" which stopped functioning. It's not a general lack of rights, and the user's role isn't the key. I'm focusing on whether \"Miscellaneous\" is too vague, or if there's a more fitting category.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Issue**\n\nThe focus is now sharpening on the issue's root.  My thinking is now gravitating toward \"Administrative rights\" being a stronger choice. The fact that an administrator's function stopped working is central. I'm moving away from \"Miscellaneous\" because it feels too broad and am now assessing how to definitively link the administrator role to the function's failure.\n\n\n**Choosing the Best Fit**\n\nI'm now weighing the \"Administrative rights\" option more heavily, given the user's \"administrator\" status and the functional breakdown. The phrase \"stopped working\" continues to suggest a problem with their ability to perform an administrative function. I'm reassessing if \"Internal Project\" is a good fit, or if the function's failure is more closely tied to the user's role.\n\n\n**Identifying the Core Problem**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the correct IT ticket category. After considering the clues, \"Administrative rights\" remains the strongest contender. The user, an administrator, can no longer use a function; this strongly points to a permissions issue. I'm focusing on \"Internal Project\" as well, since the custom spreadsheet tool may have been developed in-house.\n\n\n**Defining the Core Issue**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the correct IT ticket category. Considering the text, I've eliminated some options. The \"administrator\" role and the phrase \"stopped working\" strongly suggest an access or permissions problem. I'm choosing \"Administrative rights\" as it seems the root of this failure.\n\n\n**Categorizing this Issue**\n\nI'm leaning towards \"Administrative rights\" for this ticket. The spreadsheet \"stopped working,\" and the user is an administrator. This suggests a potential permissions or privileges problem for that specific function. I'm moving away from \"Miscellaneous\" because the administrator label is a specific clue.\n\n\n**Analyzing the Root Cause**\n\nI'm evaluating whether the \"Administrative rights\" category provides the best fit, considering the administrator's role and the function failure. The text is leaning towards this choice. \"Internal Project\" also has its merits, since it's a spreadsheet function. I'm choosing \"Administrative rights\" as the strongest choice for now.\n\n\n**Defining the Root Cause**\n\nThe current thought process is honed in on the issue's source. After examining the text, \"Administrative rights\" remains the most viable choice because the user is an administrator and a specific function is not working. The function likely requires admin permission, thus a permissions issue. I'm also considering that custom spreadsheets could fall under \"Internal Project\".\n\n\n**Prioritizing Ticket Classification**\n\nAfter reviewing the ticket, my thought process is now centered on the potential category \"Administrative rights.\" The user, an administrator, is experiencing a malfunction with a spreadsheet function, leading me to focus on possible permissions issues. I'm choosing \"Administrative rights\" for the best fit, while recognizing the merits of \"Internal Project\".\n\n\n"
