The details of the phone not functioning in the conference room are leading me to lean toward \"Hardware\". However, the mention of it having worked recently makes me reconsider if it's strictly a hardware issue or if another category might be more suitable. It is a conference room phone, so it might be a connectivity or access issue. I am now evaluating the details further to narrow down to the best fit.\n\n\n**Evaluating Hardware Issues**\n\nI've determined \"Hardware\" as the most appropriate category for the IT ticket. I've eliminated other options like \"Access\" and \"Miscellaneous\" based on the issue description. The phone not working points directly to a hardware problem, and the urgency reinforces the need for immediate attention to this category.\n\n\n"
