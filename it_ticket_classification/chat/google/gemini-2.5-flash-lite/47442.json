The symptoms point clearly to a hardware problem, specifically relating to printer connectivity. While access might be a secondary concern, the root issue seems firmly rooted in the hardware itself, and that's my focus for classification.\n\n\n**Focusing on Classification**\n\nI've determined that the \"Hardware\" category is the most appropriate for this IT ticket. The descriptions of printer problems are unambiguous and directly implicate hardware, rather than access or other potential causes. The \"not found\" and \"cannot be contacted\" messages are clear indicators of this. My classification is now complete.\n\n\n"
