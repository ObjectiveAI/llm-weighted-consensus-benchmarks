I'm carefully analyzing the keywords to pinpoint the most fitting category from the list. It feels like this is very close to HR support, but I am still working with the other potential categories.\n\n\n**Narrowing the Focus**\n\nI've honed in on the HR Support and Access categories as the most likely candidates. The \"starter form\" and \"new starter\" keywords strongly suggest HR involvement. While access is a component, the overarching request feels more HR-centric. I'm leaning toward HR Support as the primary classification. However, I'm considering if there's any need to classify this as both.\n\n\n**Prioritizing HR Focus**\n\nIt seems the best fit is \"HR Support,\" as the ticket centers on a \"starter form\" for a new employee. IT often handles the tech elements of HR requests.\n\n\n**Solidifying the Conclusion**\n\nI've circled back to the ticket's core issue: a \"starter form\" linked to a \"new starter.\"  My analysis consistently points toward HR Support as the most accurate category.  Considering the context of IT providing support for HR onboarding activities, classifying this as HR Support is the most logical. IT facilitates the form's fulfillment.\n\n\n"
