My aim is to zero in on keywords that point toward the available categories: \"Hardware\", \"HR Support\", \"Access\", \"Miscellaneous\", \"Storage\", \"Purchase\", \"Internal Project\", and \"Administrative rights\". Analyzing the provided text for these key indicators is my next step.\n\n\n**Categorizing Ticket Details**\n\nI've been working on refining the keyword extraction for category determination. The provided text, full of requests around folders and permissions, definitely points toward \"Access\" and \"Storage\", with a strong potential for \"Administrative Rights.\" I'm now examining the frequency and context of those keywords to give each category a relevance score. Further, I'm developing more precise rules to discern between different levels of access needs.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Category Assignment**\n\nI've been analyzing the text, looking closely at how keywords fit with available categories. Based on the frequency and context, \"Access\" and \"Storage\" are the strongest candidates. I'm assigning a high relevance score to \"Access\" given the direct mentions of permissions and folder arrangements. While \"Administrative Rights\" has some overlap, \"Access\" provides the overarching category for folder permissions and grants.\n\n\n**Defining Access Needs**\n\nI've carefully dissected the ticket text and determined \"Access\" to be the most fitting category. Terms like \"approval,\" \"granted,\" and the emphasis on specific folder permissions all solidify this. Although \"Administrative rights\" is related, \"Access\" best encompasses the request's core purpose: arranging folder permissions. The text confirms this with key phrases like \"exact location\" and \"broken inheritance.\"\n\n\n"
