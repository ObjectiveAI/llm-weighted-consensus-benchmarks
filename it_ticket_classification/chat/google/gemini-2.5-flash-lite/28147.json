The phrase \"custom libraries lists\" adds complexity. I'm leaning toward \"Access\" but want to ensure it fully encompasses the nuance. Need to carefully consider the specifics of the changes and the user's need.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down Categories**\n\nOkay, I've really narrowed down the categories. While \"Administrative rights\" is relevant, the core issue seems to be about accessing specific lists and libraries. The consistent use of \"permissions\" throughout the ticket text firmly pushes me towards \"Access.\" This is reinforced by \"site owners manage permissions,\" indicating control over resource accessibility. The ticket isn't directly requesting broader system administration, but rather the right to utilize the lists, as such I am moving to finalize this.\n\n\n**Confirming Category Choice**\n\nI've meticulously reviewed the ticket text again. My analysis firmly confirms \"Access\" as the most suitable category. The repeated emphasis on \"permissions,\" coupled with the specifics of managing custom lists and libraries, aligns perfectly. Although \"Administrative rights\" is a relevant term, the core issue is about controlling resource accessibility rather than broader system administration.\n\n\n"
