The ticket's content leans towards access or HR support due to references to a \"leaver form\". I'll consider the implications of a \"mobility officer\" to refine my decision. I am currently leaning toward HR Support.\n\n\n**Narrowing the Focus**\n\nMy focus is now firmly on HR Support. The \"leaver form\" is a clear indicator, and the \"mobility officer\" further reinforces this. While access is a component, the core issue stems from an employee's departure. This leans me away from Access as the primary category.\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nMy assessment now strongly favors HR Support. The text's core revolves around a \"leaver form,\" a decisive factor. The \"mobility officer\" further solidifies this direction, hinting at employee transitions. While access deactivation is a consequence, it's triggered by the employee's departure. Therefore, HR Support is the most accurate classification.\n\n\n"
