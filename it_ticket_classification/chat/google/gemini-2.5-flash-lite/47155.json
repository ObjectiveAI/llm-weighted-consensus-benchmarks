Based on terms like \"pc decommission,\" \"migration,\" and the direct mention of \"hardware,\" I'm leaning towards classifying this under the \"Hardware\" category.\n\n**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nI've completed my analysis of the IT ticket's content. My primary focus was to pinpoint the most suitable classification from the provided options, and the presence of terms like \"pc decommission,\" \"migration,\" and the explicit mention of \"hardware\" strongly indicates that \"Hardware\" is the most accurate categorization for this ticket.\n\n"
