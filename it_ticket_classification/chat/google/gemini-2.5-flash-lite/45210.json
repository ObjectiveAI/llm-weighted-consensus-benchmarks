I will check for any conflicting indicators.\n\n\n**Defining the Primary Issue**\n\nI'm now certain about the category: \"HR Support.\" The ticket's language, emphasizing leave requests, visibility, and record updates, is undeniably HR-centric. My analysis points overwhelmingly toward this designation. It appears to be an internal HR process challenge. The keywords consistently confirm this focus, ruling out other options.\n\n\n"
