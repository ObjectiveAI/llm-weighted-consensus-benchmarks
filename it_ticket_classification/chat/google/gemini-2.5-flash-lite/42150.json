I'm debating between \"Access\" and a more general category like \"Miscellaneous\" or a new one like \"Notifications\". I'm trying to decide if this indicates broader access permission, or just a small bug.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Root Cause**\n\nI've been analyzing the ticket's multifaceted issues: missing notifications, asset compliance concerns, and ticket investigation/reopening. The initial focus on notifications feels like a symptom, not the root cause. I'm leaning toward a broader category like \"Miscellaneous\" or a new one, but the asset compliance element keeps pulling me back. The non-receipt of notification feels related to the overall investigation. Considering the interplay, I'm trying to decide if the lack of notification is related to the investigation.\n\n\n**Evaluating System Processes**\n\nI'm currently focused on the ticket's core issue: the failure of notifications to be dispatched after ticket resolution.  My recent analysis suggests this might extend beyond a simple functionality bug. It seems related to a broader issue in the ticketing system's process or configuration. I'm leaning toward \"Miscellaneous\" to capture this generalized process issue, but I'm still weighing if \"Access\" is more relevant, or if a custom category like \"Ticketing System\" would be ideal. I'm focusing on the relationship between notification, resolution, and asset investigation.\n\n\n**Identifying System Function**\n\nI've been examining the described issues, particularly the notification failures and asset compliance investigation. It feels most relevant to focus on the core system functionality. The asset part is a result. I've concluded \"Miscellaneous\" is accurate, as it covers the core issue, and I'm currently leaning towards that. The problem is general.\n\n\n**Analyzing Ticket Functionality**\n\nI'm now focused on the ticket categorization. The core is the failure to send notifications upon ticket resolution, combined with the subsequent investigation into asset compliance raised in the tickets. While I initially leaned towards \"Miscellaneous,\" I'm now strongly considering the possibility of a custom category. This new category would highlight ticketing system's process failure, specifically the notification component, and associated follow-up. This emphasizes the functional aspects of ticketing and how non-compliance issues arose. I'm trying to decide between \"Miscellaneous\" and a more custom category.\n\n\n"
