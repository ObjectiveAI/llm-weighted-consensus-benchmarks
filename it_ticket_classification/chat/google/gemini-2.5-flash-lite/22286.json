I'm aiming to identify which category from the provided list (\"Hardware|HR Support|Access|Miscellaneous|Storage|Purchase|Internal Project|Administrative rights\") best aligns with these concepts to create the first categorization.\n\n\n**Categorizing Access Issues**\n\nI'm now prioritizing the \"Access\" category, as the keywords strongly suggest a focus on site permissions and owner rights. The ticket text repeatedly emphasizes access control: \"rights owner,\" \"restricted view,\" \"granted owner,\" and the need to protect sensitive information. \"Creating sites\" seems to be intrinsically linked to managing access to the new resources.\n\n\n**Focusing Access Categorization**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and am now honing in on the \"Access\" category. The keywords all point towards site permission management. \"rights owner,\" \"sensitive files,\" and \"restricted view\" are strong indicators. \"Creating sites\" also seems to imply managing access and permissions for new resources. I will continue to focus on access, to confirm this as the best match.\n\n\n**Defining Access Requirements**\n\nI've been going through the ticket details and now I'm solidifying the \"Access\" categorization. \"Rights owner,\" \"restricted view,\" and the creation of sites for vendors solidify the focus on access management. I'm moving toward a more complete understanding of these requirements.\n\n\n\n"
