It mentions a \"new headset request\" and \"headset issues,\" with the user having \"tested [the] unit [and it] worked,\" suggesting a potential hardware issue. I'm leaning toward \"Hardware\" but also considering if \"HR Support\" could be relevant.\n\n\n**Analyzing the Headset Issue**\n\nI've determined the correct category for this ticket is \"Hardware.\" The user's description, including phrases like \"headset issues,\" \"tested unit worked,\" and \"headset itself faulty,\" all point to a hardware-related problem. The ticket mentions troubleshooting and drivers, but these are secondary to the central issue of a malfunctioning headset.\n\n\n"
