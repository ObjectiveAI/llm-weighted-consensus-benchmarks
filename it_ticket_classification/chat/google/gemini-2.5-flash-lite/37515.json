The text indicates an issue with an \"oracle time card\", leading me to believe it falls under \"HR Support\" or potentially \"Access\" if it's related to login or permissions. I'm leaning toward \"HR Support\" as the primary issue seems to be a time card discrepancy.\n\n\n**Revisiting Ticket Categorization**\n\nMy focus has shifted to refining the category selection. While \"HR Support\" still feels appropriate given the Oracle time card issue, I'm now questioning if \"Access\" deserves more consideration. The \"permission change manually\" phrase is making me pause, though the issue *is* a data correction in the end. I'm leaning heavily on \"HR Support\", but I'm checking it again.\n\n\n**Categorizing Ticket: Final Decision**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's keywords and the available categories. \"HR Support\" still appears the most accurate fit. While the mention of \"permission change manually\" introduced a brief consideration of \"Access,\" the core issue is correcting a time card entry. Therefore, despite the administrative action needed, the root of the problem and the user's need fall squarely within \"HR Support\". The administrative action is a means to correct data, not the central problem itself.\n\n\n"
