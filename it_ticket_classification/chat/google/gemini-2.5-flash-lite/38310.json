The core issue appears to be an expired account for a user who recently transitioned from a contractor to an employee.\n\n**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm evaluating the IT ticket's content, focusing on the keywords related to the user's account status and recent employment change. My current assessment points strongly towards the \"Access\" category, given the explicit mention of an expired account and the implications of a status shift from contractor to employee on system privileges.\n\n**Refining Ticket Assignment**\n\nI'm solidifying the categorization of the IT ticket, confirming that the core issue of an expired account, especially in light of a recent contractor-to-employee status change, falls squarely under the \"Access\" category. This seems to be the most appropriate and direct fit.\n\n"
