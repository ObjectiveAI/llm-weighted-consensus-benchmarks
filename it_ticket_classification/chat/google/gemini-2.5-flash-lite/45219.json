It's challenging due to the repetition and lack of clear details. I'm trying to decipher if the phrase \"still some issues with\" refers to a specific hardware component, an access problem, or a more general operational glitch. My instinct is leaning towards a broader category due to the ambiguity. I'm now analyzing the timestamp - could Thursday offer an important clue?\n\n\n**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's language, zeroing in on keywords like \"leave days\" and \"employee calendars.\" These terms firmly point me towards an HR Support issue. Although an access problem *could* be involved, the core issue seems to be the functionality of HR systems related to leave. Therefore, \"HR Support\" is the most suitable, concrete classification.\n\n\n"
