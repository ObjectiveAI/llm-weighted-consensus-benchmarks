It seems related to phone issues, specifically around receiving calls and functionality. I'm leaning towards categorizing this under \"Hardware\", since the core issue seems to be a physical device. However, I want to ensure other categories are properly considered before making a final decision.\n\n\n**Revising Hardware Designation**\n\nI've refined the initial hardware categorization. Considering the specific symptoms, I'm now leaning heavily towards a \"Hardware\" classification for this phone-related ticket. The core issue of receiving calls and experiencing disconnections strongly points to a physical device problem. I'm confident in this choice.\n\n\n"
