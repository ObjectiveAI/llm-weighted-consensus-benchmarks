I'm double-checking the other categories to confirm this initial assessment.\n\n\n**Finalizing Ticket Assignment**\n\nI've reviewed the ticket description in detail: \"time sheet card problems for july,\" along with additional details. I've considered all categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights.  My analysis of the \"card\" issues, holiday display errors, and code removal failures, confirms my initial assessment. \"HR Support\" is the correct classification for this ticket.\n\n\n"
