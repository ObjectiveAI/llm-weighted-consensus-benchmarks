Based on keywords like \"new starter\" and \"internship program,\" I'm leaning towards classifying it under \"HR Support\" or possibly \"Access.\" I'll cross-reference with the exact ticket details to finalize the category.\n\n**Refining Ticket Classification**\n\nI'm focusing on assigning the appropriate category to the IT ticket. Given the mention of a \"new starter\" and an \"internship program,\" \"HR Support\" is a strong contender. The request to \"change accounts credentials\" also points towards \"Access,\" suggesting a potential overlap or a need to select the primary focus. I'm weighing these against the full ticket context.\n\n**Categorizing Onboarding Tickets**\n\nI'm now processing the details of a new IT ticket. The inclusion of terms like \"new starter,\" \"internship program,\" and \"accepted job offer\" strongly indicates an \"HR Support\" classification. However, the explicit request to \"change accounts credentials\" also points towards \"Access,\" suggesting the need to select the most encompassing category or potentially split the request if the system allows.\n\n**Focusing on Onboarding**\n\nI'm currently categorizing a new IT ticket. The presence of \"new starter,\" \"internship program,\" and \"accepted job offer\" strongly suggests the \"HR Support\" category. While \"change accounts credentials\" points to \"Access,\" the overarching context of onboarding a new employee makes \"HR Support\" the primary classification I'm considering.\n\n**Categorizing New Hires**\n\nI'm currently categorizing an IT ticket. Based on terms like \"new starter,\" \"internship program,\" and \"accepted job offer,\" the primary classification appears to be \"HR Support.\" While \"change accounts credentials\" suggests an \"Access\" category, the broader context of onboarding a new employee points to HR as the main focus.\n\n**Prioritizing Onboarding Context**\n\nI'm classifying the IT ticket. Given the strong indicators of \"new starter,\" \"accepted job offer,\" and \"permanent status,\" \"HR Support\" is my primary consideration. The request to \"change accounts credentials\" is noted, but the overarching context of employee onboarding points to HR as the most appropriate category.\n\n**Assigning Onboarding Ticket**\n\nI'm classifying this IT ticket by focusing on the abundance of new starter indicators. Terms like \"accepted job offer\" and \"permanent status\" strongly point towards \"HR Support\" as the primary category, even with the mention of \"change accounts credentials.\"\n\n"
