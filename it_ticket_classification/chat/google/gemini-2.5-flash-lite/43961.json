I've begun to incorporate keyword identification and contextual analysis, and I'm planning to compare the keywords with category descriptors to refine the process. I'm exploring an iterative refinement approach where the model analyzes and re-analyzes a ticket description to progressively determine the category.\n\n\n**Evaluating Initial Category Fit**\n\nThe ticket description analysis has begun, and I've started examining key phrases to determine category fit. Given the phrasing about employee data and a software developer, I'm leaning toward \"HR Support\" or \"Internal Project\". I've ruled out \"Hardware\", as the issue seems software-based, not physical. I'm focusing on \"employee details screen\" to see if it provides an additional category fit.\n\n\n**Confirming Internal Project Category**\n\nAfter reviewing the ticket description and analyzing key phrases like \"employee details screen issue\", \"software developer\", and \"code\", I've settled on \"Internal Project\" as the most appropriate category. It clearly reflects a software-related problem within an internal system, aligning with the description's core elements.\n\n\n"
