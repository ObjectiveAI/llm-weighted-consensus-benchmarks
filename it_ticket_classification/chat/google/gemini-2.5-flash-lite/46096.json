I've read the text, and it seems related to an approval flow or requisition. I'm torn between \"Purchase\" and \"Internal Project\", but I'm leaning toward purchase since there's mention of approvals. It's a tricky one!\n\n\n**Narrowing the Focus**\n\nI've honed in on the ticket's core issue: an approval requisition flow with budget concerns. The text, rife with financial cues like \"budget\" and \"money come out,\" firmly points toward a purchase. While \"Internal Project\" could be a factor, \"Purchase\" aligns more directly with the core problem of an approval flow tied to budget expenditure. I've eliminated irrelevant categories and I'm very confident with my decision.\n\n\n**Revisiting the Categories**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket text with the available categories in mind. The approval flow and budget concerns really stand out, making \"Purchase\" the most relevant. While \"Internal Project\" is still a possibility if it's an internal project-related purchase, the focus on approvals and expenditure leads me back to \"Purchase.\" I'm now fairly certain in my decision.\n\n\n"
