I'm leaning toward HR Support, given the form and onboarding context, however the lack of information does leave some uncertainty.\n\n\n**Refining Category Selection**\n\nI'm now prioritizing the \"HR Support\" category, as the new starter/contractor context aligns perfectly with its scope. The \"Access\" category is also relevant, but secondary as the initial request is onboarding. My analysis centers on the provided ticket text, noting the emphasis on a \"starter form,\" \"new starter,\" and \"contractor\" type. The location details are useful but not a primary driver of the categorization. I am continuing to refine how these factors weigh.\n\n\n**Finalizing Categorization Decision**\n\nI've determined that \"HR Support\" is the best fit for this ticket. The phrases \"new starter,\" \"starter form,\" and \"contractor\" all strongly indicate an HR-related onboarding process. While access provisioning is a likely consequence, the request's core is HR-driven. The analysis of the text prioritized the context of the onboarding process, leading me to definitively conclude \"HR Support\" as the primary category.\n\n\n"
