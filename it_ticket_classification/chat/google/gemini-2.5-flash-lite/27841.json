Initial keywords like \"new starter,\" \"oracle,\" and \"friday\" are being analyzed for relevance. The goal is to determine the most fitting category from the options provided, considering both explicit terms and potential implicit meanings within the short message. I am now looking at the other keywords for any other context clues.\n\n\n**Pinpointing Primary Focus**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's keywords. \"New starter\" and the implied onboarding tasks strongly point to HR Support. While \"oracle\" suggests a potential system access need, the central issue revolves around the onboarding of a new employee, making HR Support the most relevant category. Access might be a secondary consideration, but it is driven by HR needs.\n\n\n**Determining Primary Driver**\n\nI'm now fully immersed in the core issue. Analyzing \"new starter\", the date context, and the implied request, the HR Support category emerges as the most fitting. Although \"oracle\" hints at system access, it's a *consequence* of the onboarding need, making the new hire's setup the central focus. I'm focusing on the *reason* for the ticket rather than the specific system, with an eye towards HR Support.\n\n\n"
