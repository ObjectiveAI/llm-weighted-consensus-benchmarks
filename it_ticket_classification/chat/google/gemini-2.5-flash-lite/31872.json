I've analyzed the text and am leaning towards \"HR Support\" due to phrases like \"amend employee\", \"leaving announcement notifications\", and \"leaver.\" I'm also considering if there's an overlap and if it should include \"Access\".\n\n\n**Prioritizing HR Focus**\n\nMy current priority is firmly on \"HR Support.\" The recurring theme of \"leaver,\" \"leaving announcement,\" and \"employee\" is definitively pushing me towards this classification. While access changes might be a secondary consequence, the core of the ticket revolves around HR-related departure processes. I've ruled out the other categories as they don't capture the essence of the request.\n\n\n**Reaffirming HR Classification**\n\nI'm now fully committed to \"HR Support\" as the definitive category. The consistent mentions of \"leaver,\" \"leaving announcement,\" and associated departure processes seal the deal. While potential access adjustments are indirectly present, the central issue is undeniably HR-centric. My analysis has eliminated all other categories as unsuitable. The ticket's core is HR-related and that is my chosen assessment.\n\n\n"
