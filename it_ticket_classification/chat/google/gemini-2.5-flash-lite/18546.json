My focus is on classifying it accurately within the given categories: \"Hardware\", \"HR Support\", \"Access\", \"Miscellaneous\", \"Storage\", \"Purchase\", \"Internal Project\", and \"Administrative rights\". The ticket mentions \"infra domain memberships audit,\" which strongly suggests an access-related issue.\n\n**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm analyzing the ticket's content. The phrase \"infra domain memberships audit\" and subsequent discussion of user accounts, group memberships, disabled accounts, and authentication strongly indicate this falls under \"Access.\" I'm finalizing this classification.\n\n**Refining Ticket Classification**\n\nI've thoroughly analyzed the provided IT ticket content. My thoughts confirm that the extensive discussion around domain memberships, user accounts, group permissions, disabled accounts due to departures, and authentication protocols firmly places this under the \"Access\" category.\n\n**Auditing Access Control**\n\nMy thoughts are now focused on confirming the final categorization of the IT ticket. Having thoroughly reviewed the content, the extensive discussion around domain memberships, user accounts (both active and disabled, particularly those of recent leavers), group permissions, and authentication protocols decisively places this ticket within the \"Access\" category.\n\n**Categorizing Ticket Access**\n\nMy latest thoughts confirm the IT ticket's classification. The comprehensive audit of domain memberships, user accounts (including disabled ones and those of recent leavers), and authentication protocols firmly establishes it within the \"Access\" category.\n\n"
