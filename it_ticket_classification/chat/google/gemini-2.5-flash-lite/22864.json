After careful consideration of the text and the available options, \"Access\" seems like the most fitting choice. The ticket's content suggests an issue revolving around access cards and usage, which aligns directly with this category.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Options**\n\nI've been evaluating the suitability of other options besides \"Access\". While \"Hardware\" is tempting given the physical nature of the cards, the core of the issue lies in their management and usage. \"Purchase\" seems less relevant, as the ticket is more about the deployment and tracking of existing cards. I'm leaning more towards \"Access\" for the moment.\n\n\n**Finalizing Category Selection**\n\nMy thinking has solidified. After a thorough review of the ticket content \u2013 specifically, the emphasis on \"access cards usage\" and assignment \u2013 the \"Access\" category seems definitively correct. While other categories have surface relevance, \"Access\" best encapsulates the core issue described in the ticket, which pertains to the cards' distribution and control.\n\n\n"
