After analyzing the text, my initial instinct is \"Storage,\" but the mention of \"upload\" and \"colleagues\" makes me consider \"Access\" as well.  The context leans more towards a need for a network location for uploading, which feels closer to storage than access, which is usually permission related. I'm weighing the specific words to make a final call.\n\n\n**Confirming Category Choice**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket details, focusing on \"network location needed\" and \"upload\". While access permissions might be implied, the core request is a storage solution. After a final review, I'm confident \"Storage\" is the most fitting category, as it directly addresses the need for a file upload location.\n\n\n"
