I'm leaning toward Storage, but I'm also considering Access, given the mention of \"confidential\" information. I'm focusing on whether this involves data removal or access control. My current working assumption is storage-related, but I'm still weighing the other possibilities.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Data Deletion**\n\nI'm now focusing on the \"delete\" request and its relation to \"confidential information\" to narrow down the ticket type. I've ruled out Hardware, HR Support, Purchase, and Internal Project. Access is being considered, but the primary action is deletion, so Storage still seems most relevant. I'm carefully reviewing the context around \"delete\" to confirm this.\n\n\n**Pinpointing Storage Needs**\n\nI'm now prioritizing the \"delete\" request combined with \"confidential information\" to solidify the IT ticket type. I've eliminated categories such as Hardware, HR Support, Purchase, and Internal Project. Access is considered, but the primary action is deletion. The deletion of data is the primary request. Storage remains the most suitable. I'm focusing on the relationship between \"delete\" and \"list\".\n\n\n"
