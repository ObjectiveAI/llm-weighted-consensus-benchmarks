My process involves analyzing the ticket's content to identify the core issue, which appears to be a service disruption impacting user productivity. I'm cross-referencing this with the available categories to select the most appropriate one.\n\n**Identifying Ticket Type**\n\nI've analyzed the provided ticket text, and the core issue clearly points to a malfunctioning piece of equipment or software, significantly hindering user productivity. Based on this, I'm leaning towards classifying it under \"Hardware\" due to the \"not working\" description and the potential typo for \"loaner.\"\n\n**Classifying the Issue**\n\nI'm currently analyzing the ticket details to pinpoint the primary problem. The mention of something \"not working\" and \"impacting productivity greatly\" strongly suggests a functional failure, likely hardware-related, especially with the hint of a \"loaner.\"\n\n**Investigating Ticket Details**\n\nI'm currently refining my categorization based on the ticket's specifics. The phrasing \"on is not working\" is quite general, but combined with the mention of a potential \"loner\" (likely loaner), I'm leaning towards \"Hardware\" as the most probable category for this functionality issue that greatly impacts productivity.\n\n**Focusing on Classification**\n\nMy current efforts are directed at accurately categorizing the IT ticket. I've been analyzing the user's description, particularly the phrases \"not working\" and \"impacts productivity greatly,\" to determine the most fitting classification from the available options. The potential typo of \"loner\" for \"loaner\" has further guided my assessment towards a specific category.\n\n"
