I'm focusing on the core issue: the mailbox being full. Given the options, I'm leaning toward 'Storage' as the primary category. It's the most directly related to the issue, and not an HR, access or administrative rights matter.\n\n\n**Defining the Category**\n\nI've reviewed the ticket content again. The phrase \"mailbox almost full\" is central, along with mentions of size limits. Considering the available categories, \"Storage\" remains the clear frontrunner. I'm confirming this aligns with the ticket's goal of addressing insufficient storage capacity. It's not about HR, access, or administrative rights, so it's most likely to be Storage.\n\n\n"
