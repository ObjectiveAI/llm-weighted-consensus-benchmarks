                    "reasoning": "**Identifying the Category**\n\nI am now focusing on the words \"builds not working\" to determine the most relevant category. My current assessment leans towards a technical issue, but I need to ensure it doesn't fall under a more specific category like \"Storage\" or \"Purchase\".\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've been analyzing the provided text and associating phrases like \"builds not working\" and \"fails after checking connections\" to the given categories. My current thinking steers away from hardware failure, HR support, or purchase requests. It seems more about a broader system configuration problem, potentially related to network connectivity during the build process. Access might be a factor, but not the primary cause.\n\n\n**Categorizing System Issues**\n\nI'm now focusing on categorizing this IT ticket. After considering the \"builds not working,\" \"boot back up,\" and \"server access\" phrases, I've eliminated \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" and \"Internal Project.\" While the system failing after checking connections might relate to access, I think \"Administrative rights\" is relevant since the boot process often requires elevated privileges. Ultimately, the broader description of the system's operational failure during the build process, combined with the server connection issues, points to a more general \"Miscellaneous\" category.\n\n\n**Revising Categorization Focus**\n\nI'm now revising my category selection. While \"Administrative rights\" might be relevant, the main problem seems to be the system's overall operational failure during the boot/build sequence, related to network connectivity and server communication. I'm focusing on the broad functionality issue, leaning away from specific hardware failure or user access issues.\n\n\n**Analyzing System Failure**\n\nI've been meticulously examining the ticket's language, zeroing in on phrases like \"boot back up\" and \"builds not working.\" My thoughts have led me to believe the problem is an issue related to the system's ability to boot or complete its build sequence. I'm focusing on why the system is failing during this process, considering possible network connectivity problems or server access issues that might require administrative intervention. I'm now leaning towards the broader category of \"Miscellaneous\" to encompass the core functional failure, rather than assuming a single specific cause.\n\n\n**Finalizing the Categorization**\n\nMy focus has shifted to the system's core functionality. The recent analysis suggests a broad system failure during the boot or build sequence, with network and server connectivity issues at the root. Despite the possibility of access issues, the core problem is a failure to complete a critical system operation, best captured by the \"Miscellaneous\" category.\n\n\n**Defining the Root Problem**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the system's core malfunction, which is the inability to boot up or complete builds due to network and server communication issues. The \"Access\" category seems increasingly relevant, considering that the system's failure relates to server access during the critical boot/build phase.\n\n\n**Categorizing the System Failure**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and I think the \"Access\" category is the best fit. I've considered that the system's core failure seems related to an inability to reach network resources or servers required during the boot or build process, despite considering \"Administrative rights\".\n\n\n**Re-Evaluating the Root Cause**\n\nI'm now focusing on the key phrases. \"Builds not working\" and \"tries find server\" point towards network connectivity. I am re-evaluating if \"Access\" is the most appropriate category. Though it's possible that the builds are dependent on proper admin rights.\n\n\n**Resolving System Connectivity**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on why the system fails during the build or boot process due to connectivity problems. While administrative rights could be a factor, the core issue appears to be access-related. I am revising my selection to \"Access\" because of its clear alignment with the ticket's network and server interaction issues.\n\n\n"
