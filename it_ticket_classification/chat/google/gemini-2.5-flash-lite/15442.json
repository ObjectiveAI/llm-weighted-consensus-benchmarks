Considering the provided text, the phrase \"make slave dedicated to builds,\" \"make slave dedicated builds,\" \"created slave dedicated build,\" and \"jobs\" seem to point towards an infrastructure-related concern, possibly \"Storage\" or \"Internal Project.\" I'm carefully weighing these possibilities, aiming for the most accurate classification.\n\n\n**Determining the best fit**\n\nI've been evaluating the optimal category. Given the ticket text containing \"make slave dedicated to builds,\" \"jobs executed slave,\" and similar phrases, I'm leaning toward \"Internal Project.\" While \"Hardware\" is a possibility if a physical machine is involved, the focus on \"build slaves\" leans towards software infrastructure. The \"Administrative rights\" category isn't a direct fit, as the issue pertains to system configuration, not user access. Therefore, \"Internal Project\" seems most suitable, unless additional context changes the analysis.\n\n\n**Analyzing Category Suitability**\n\nI'm now diving deeper into the nuances of each category. While \"Hardware\" remains a possibility, the consistent focus on \"build slaves\" and \"jobs\" leads me towards \"Internal Project.\" I'm also examining the implications of \"dedicated\" versus general-purpose hardware. Considering the functional configuration is being described, and not just the request for a physical machine. I'm focusing on the implied workflow and internal processes. I am assessing if there is another better category fit than the currently believed.\n\n\n**Evaluating Hardware Implications**\n\nI'm now refining the category choice. The more I analyze, the more \"Hardware\" becomes relevant due to the \"slave\" being a machine. However, the phrases such as \"dedicated to builds\" and \"jobs executed\" still point to a focus on the functional configuration of the machine. I'm carefully weighing whether the *purpose* outweighs the *physicality* in this categorization decision.\n\n\n"
