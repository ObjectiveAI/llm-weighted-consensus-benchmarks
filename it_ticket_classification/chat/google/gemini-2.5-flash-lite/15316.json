The phrase \"work terms\" is sticking out. I've narrowed it down to a few options and plan to carefully evaluate them against the given categories. My aim is to make the most accurate assignment possible.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Request**\n\nI'm now carefully examining the ticket's keywords against the available categories. \"Work terms\" and \"employee submissions\" are key phrases I'm considering. Initially, HR support seemed promising, but the focus on \"documentation links\" and \"finding a document\" is swaying me toward something else. The \"manage cards\" term further complicates things. I'm leaning away from hardware, access, storage, and purchase. Internal project isn't a good fit either. Let's dig deeper into my options.\n\n\n**Defining the Core Need**\n\nI'm now carefully processing the ticket's core requirement. My analysis has led me to believe the key focus is not IT-specific. \"Work terms\" and \"submission\" strongly suggest HR. It's about finding documentation for employee-related processes, therefore \"HR Support\" seems like the most relevant classification. While the 'manage cards' aspect is ambiguous, I'm leaning toward HR's involvement with employee ID or access card processes.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the ticket text and I'm currently leaning towards \"HR Support.\" The phrase \"work terms submissions\" continues to be a crucial indicator. My process of elimination has solidified the conclusion that the need for finding documentation relating to this process is HR-focused. While \"manage cards\" is ambiguous, I'm now confident that it contributes to the broader context of an HR-related task. This helps me feel increasingly comfortable with my classification.\n\n\n"
