The ticket text's emphasis on \"shared folder request\" and \"storing video recordings\" is significant. I'm carefully weighing the options to pinpoint the most accurate classification. My initial inclination is to lean toward \"Storage\" due to the core need for video storage. However, I want to make sure I'm not overlooking any subtle nuances. I'm going to make sure that \"Miscellaneous\" is a backup for any areas I might have missed.\n\n\n**Narrowing down the options**\n\nI've refined the ticket classification, focusing on \"Storage\" as the primary category. The \"shared folder request\" reinforces the \"Storage\" need. I've considered \"Access,\" but the core request centers on storing the video, not just access. I feel quite secure in this final classification. I am also making sure that if I miss something, I can always fallback on \"Miscellaneous\" as a last resort.\n\n\n"
