                    "reasoning": "**Examining Ticket Details**\n\nOkay, I'm diving into the ticket description now. \"Oracle new code hi please code per attached thanks\" seems pretty straightforward, but I'm going to carefully consider each word. The phrase \"new code\" is the most prominent part, with the rest as a thank you. I need to make sure I am accurate, and don't misinterpret the situation, as is sometimes the case with natural language. I'm leaning toward considering the words \"new code\" and looking for an appropriate category related to that.\n\n\n**Refining Categorization Strategy**\n\nI've been meticulously examining the ticket details, particularly the phrase \"oracle new code.\"  While \"Internal Project\" felt initially appropriate, I'm now leaning towards a more specific category if one exists.  The core request is development-oriented, and I'm reconsidering if any implicit assumptions about an internal project are necessary.  The \"new code\" aspect is pivotal, and I'm trying to ensure I haven't overlooked any nuances in the available categories.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Oracle Request**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the ticket description, focusing on the core request for \"new code.\" I'm now leaning towards \"Internal Project,\" given the IT context and the likelihood of the coding being for internal systems. However, I'm considering the possibility that this might be a small, standalone task rather than part of a larger project, and considering if \"Miscellaneous\" might be a more fitting choice to cover this broad scenario if project details are absent. The phrase \"new code\" and the \"Oracle\" component point in the direction of an application update or development.\n\n\n**Choosing The Optimal Category**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the best category: \"Internal Project\". I've analyzed the ticket's core request for \"new code\" and the mention of Oracle. The phrase \"code per attached\" suggests a defined task, typical of projects, and it's most likely for internal IT purposes.  I'm confident \"Internal Project\" is a precise choice. If it's simply a script, perhaps, \"Miscellaneous\". But the details likely reflect an internal development project.\n\n\n"
