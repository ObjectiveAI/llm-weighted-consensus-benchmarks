Right now, I'm focusing on \"decommission,\" which seems most closely related to either \"Storage\" or \"Hardware.\" I'll need to analyze the surrounding text to make the final call. The provided text looks minimal so far, so that may be a challenge. I need to be sure before I make any decisions.\n\n\n**Revisiting Category Choices**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket content: \"decommissioning the server,\" \"archive databases,\" and \"restore databases.\" The words \"volume mb\" and \"backup\" further solidify the focus on data. \"Hardware\" might be involved, but \"Storage\" is the core action. While an \"Internal Project\" is a possibility, the wording is too focused on storage-related activities to support that. \"Miscellaneous\" still feels too broad, and the other categories aren't relevant. I'm leaning heavily towards \"Storage\" as the best fit.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Best Fit**\n\nI'm now focusing on definitively linking the ticket to \"Storage\". The keywords like \"archive,\" \"restore,\" \"backup,\" and \"databases\" are central. Although \"decommissioning the server\" touches on hardware, the core action is data-centric, making \"Storage\" the better choice. I'm excluding \"Hardware\" because the focus is on data, and other categories are completely irrelevant. \"Internal Project\" is a possibility but feels too vague given the data-focused language.\n\n\n"
