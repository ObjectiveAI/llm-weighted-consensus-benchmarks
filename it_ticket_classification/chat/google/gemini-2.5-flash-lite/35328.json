I've noted \"performance issues,\" the \"amp endpoint\" mention, and the intention to \"replace our current solution with anti\" (presumably antivirus). My initial thought is to consider \"Hardware\" for the performance issues, \"Miscellaneous\" because of the vague anti and amp mention, but the specific details don't strongly point to any category. Further analysis is needed to identify the main topic of the ticket.\n\n\n**Identifying Core Project Focus**\n\nI've determined that the \"Internal Project\" category best suits this IT ticket. The core content clearly revolves around the rollout or update of endpoint security software, despite the initial mention of \"performance issues\" which I believe is a secondary concern. I've re-examined the ticket details, prioritizing the \"amp endpoint\" and the intention to replace the existing solution, and the rollout-specific action prompts, and confirmed the categorization.\n\n\n"
