It's becoming clearer that the primary concern centers around physical entry and possibly security card allocation. My thought process is narrowing down the category to either \"Access\" or a specialized subcategory of \"Hardware\" linked to physical security systems. I'm carefully sifting for definitive indicators.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've determined that \"Access\" is the most fitting category for the ticket. The critical elements, \"physical access\" and \"allocate card,\" underscore that the central concern is physical entry permissions. The language doesn't imply hardware failure or HR-related tasks, nor does it involve data storage, purchases, or projects. It's a straightforward access request.\n\n\n"
