So far, \"Hardware\" seems like a strong contender due to the mention of a \"broken cable.\" I'm also considering whether \"Miscellaneous\" might apply given the somewhat vague nature of the request, even though it is about hardware. I need to make sure the ticket is not an internal project. It could be HR support, which is not obvious at all, but I will continue my examination to make sure I am choosing the right category.\n\n\n**Identifying the Root Cause**\n\nI've honed in on the key phrase, \"broken meeting room cable,\" which definitively points towards a hardware issue. Despite considering other options like \"Miscellaneous,\" the specific mention of a broken cable solidified \"Hardware\" as the most appropriate category. I'm confident I have successfully identified the core problem.\n\n\n"
