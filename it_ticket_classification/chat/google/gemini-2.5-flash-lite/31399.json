After analyzing the keywords, I'm leaning towards \"HR Support.\" The mention of \"new starter,\" \"induction,\" and \"form\" points strongly in that direction. However, I'm still considering potential overlaps and need to ensure it's the most accurate fit.\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nI've been drilling down on the \"HR Support\" category, now focusing on how it encapsulates the entire onboarding workflow implied by the ticket. While access is a component, the primary issue seems to be the initiation of the new hire process, including form completion and induction, which all fall squarely under HR's purview. I'm satisfied that \"HR Support\" provides the most accurate and encompassing classification.\n\n\n**Selecting the Primary Category**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's text, identifying key phrases such as \"new starter,\" \"starter form,\" and \"induction.\" While \"RD testing\" introduces a slight ambiguity, the dominant theme revolves around onboarding and supporting new hires. Therefore, I'm confident that \"HR Support\" is the most accurate and encompassing category, reflecting the primary issue.\n\n\n"
