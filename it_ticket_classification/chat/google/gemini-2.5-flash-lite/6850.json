Keywords like \"new starter\", \"join\", and \"form\" are jumping out. I'm leaning toward \"HR Support\" as the most relevant category based on this quick scan. However, I want to confirm my hunch.\n\n\n**Confirming HR Relevance**\n\nI've further analyzed the ticket content and pinpointed the core issue: the form completion process for a new employee. The phrasing \"new starter starter form\" solidified my initial instinct. Considering the available categories, \"HR Support\" clearly aligns with this need. The request is demonstrably connected to administrative steps within the onboarding process, solidifying this as the appropriate designation.\n\n\n**Revisiting Onboarding Details**\n\nCurrently, I'm taking a second look at the ticket to make sure my initial classification holds up. Keywords related to \"new starter\" are again the focal point. Considering the details in conjunction with the HR Support category, I think the request involves filling out an \"onboarding form\", and I am pretty sure \"HR Support\" is the right category. The request seems strongly connected with the administrative steps of onboarding, with the request involving the \"completion\" of the new starter form.\n\n\n"
