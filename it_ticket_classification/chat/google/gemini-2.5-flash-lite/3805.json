I'm carefully reviewing the ticket text, specifically \"access points map re points map\". This phrase seems crucial, and I'm weighing whether \"Access\" or \"Miscellaneous\" is the better fit. My understanding of the text is developing to where I need to take the next step.\n\n\n**Narrowing Category Choices**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on \"Hardware\" as the primary category. The \"access points\" phrasing, along with mentions of \"infrastructure plans\" and \"layout map\", strongly point towards a hardware-related issue. \"Access\" is a possibility but feels secondary. While \"Miscellaneous\" and \"Storage\" are too broad, the ticket's core seems centered on maps depicting hardware and its related infrastructure. I'll need to confirm that \"Hardware\" encompasses this specific map-centric use case.\n\n\n**Defining the Primary Focus**\n\nI'm solidifying my rationale for \"Hardware\".  While other categories, like \"Access\" and \"Internal Project\", have a peripheral connection, the consistent theme of \"access points\", infrastructure, and layout maps points squarely at hardware-related concerns.  The ticket's emphasis is on the physical representation and management of these elements, solidifying the choice of \"Hardware\".\n\n\n"
