Keywords like \"leaver\" point towards account deactivation, access revocation and possibly notification setup. I'm carefully considering how to map \"leaver\" to a suitable category from the provided list.\n\n\n**Defining Access Category**\n\nI am now focusing on refining the category. \"Leaver AD\" strongly indicates a need to revoke *access* which I'll focus on. \"Glide notification inbound\" could be a follow up or related to the user access removal process. I am trying to determine if Glide is a separate system to consider here.\n\n\n**Refining Category Selection**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the best category. Thinking more about the ticket's nature, \"Access\" seems the best fit. I believe it is about disabling the account access of an employee who is leaving. I initially considered \"HR Support\" because the process originates with HR, but the actual IT task is about access management and I feel that fits better here. \"Glide notification inbound\" likely points to a system notification related to this access management process.\n\n\n**Categorizing Ticket Action**\n\nI've decided to finalize the category as \"Access,\" since the primary action is account deactivation. \"Leaver AD\" points to removing access permissions, which is an access management task within the context of a leaver. \"Glide notification inbound\" likely points to a system notification related to this access change.\n\n\n"
