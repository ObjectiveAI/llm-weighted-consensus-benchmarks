The text \"guest can connect his laptop to external monitor wednesday july\" suggests a potential hardware issue. I'm carefully weighing this against other categories like \"Access,\" but I'm leaning toward \"Hardware.\"\n\n\n**Identifying the Root Cause**\n\nI've thoroughly analyzed the ticket content, focusing on keywords like \"external monitor,\" \"monitor cable,\" and \"connect.\" These strongly point towards a hardware issue. After comparing these keywords to each category, I've eliminated all but \"Hardware.\" This is a perfect match because it directly addresses the problem with the monitor and cable, and I'm ready to output this as the chosen category.\n\n\n"
