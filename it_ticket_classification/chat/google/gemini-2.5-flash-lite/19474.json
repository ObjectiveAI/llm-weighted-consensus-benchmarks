The mention of a departing member strongly suggests an Access or HR Support related issue. Considering the available categories, I'm leaning toward Access, specifically user permissions. The context seems more about controlling user access upon departure.\n\n\n**Defining the Core Issue**\n\nI've refined my initial analysis, and am now confident in categorizing the ticket. After dissecting the text, the key phrase \"owner has left\" solidified my perspective. While \"Access\" is a potential downstream implication, the primary trigger is an employee departure, making \"HR Support\" the most accurate classification. I've eliminated other categories based on their lack of relevance to the provided context. My focus is on the human resources aspect driving this request.\n\n\n"
