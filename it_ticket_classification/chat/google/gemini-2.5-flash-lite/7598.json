My analysis of \"new starter template\" and \"modify template\" keywords strongly suggests \"HR Support\" as the most fitting category, given the common association with onboarding processes.\n\n**Categorizing Ticket Details**\n\nMy thoughts are now zeroing in on \"HR Support\" as the most logical category. The phrase \"new starter template\" strongly indicates a connection to onboarding processes, which typically fall under HR functions.\n\n**Refining Category Assignment**\n\nI'm actively considering \"HR Support\" as the primary category due to the clear mention of \"new starter template\" and the associated task of modification. This aligns well with typical onboarding workflows facilitated by IT.\n\n**Selecting HR Support**\n\nMy thoughts are now focused on categorizing this IT ticket. Given the explicit mention of \"new starter template\" and the request to \"modify template\", \"HR Support\" appears to be the most fitting category as it directly relates to onboarding processes for new employees.\n\n**Finalizing Ticket Category**\n\nMy current focus is on solidifying the categorization of this IT ticket. I'm confident that \"HR Support\" is the most accurate classification, given the explicit mention of a \"new starter template\" and the request for its modification, which directly aligns with onboarding procedures.\n\n"
