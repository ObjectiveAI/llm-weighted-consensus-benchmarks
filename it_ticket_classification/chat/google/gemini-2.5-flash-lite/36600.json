The repeated mention of \"requisition rejected\" strongly suggests this pertains to the \"Purchase\" category, a key area to explore. I'm building confidence in this classification based on the recurring phrase.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Scope**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and strong signals point towards a purchase requisition. The language used, like \"requisition rejected,\" \"supplier,\" \"cost,\" and \"laptop,\" solidly align with a purchase-related issue.  I'm now focusing on confirming the hardware aspect implied by \"laptop\" to solidify this categorization.\n\n\n**Analyzing the Hardware Request**\n\nCurrently, I'm examining the specific reason for the rejected requisition more deeply. The text strongly indicates a request for new hardware (a laptop) due to performance issues. While \"Hardware\" is relevant, the core issue revolves around the *purchase* process itself. Therefore, I believe categorizing this as \"Purchase\" is the most accurate classification. I'm focusing now on how to best frame the resolution steps, understanding that the hardware need is the underlying cause for the rejection.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Issue**\n\nThe focus has shifted to explicitly defining the issue type. After carefully reviewing the ticket's components, it's clear the core problem is a \"Purchase\" issue. The multiple \"requisition rejected\" instances, along with detailed information about the laptop, the supplier, cost, and approval stages all reinforce this classification. The specific rejection points toward an issue with the purchasing process itself.\n\n\n"
