The keywords \"purchase\" and \"po\" strongly suggest this relates to procuring something. I'm leaning toward \"Purchase\" as the most appropriate category. Considering the nature of the words \"Friday PM\" and \"Inch Pro\", I might require more information to better understand the nature of the \"purchase\", although the category seems rather obvious, so I'll keep it as such.\n\n\n**Pinpointing Ticket Purpose**\n\nI've zeroed in on the \"Purchase\" category, confirming my initial assessment. The key phrase \"new purchase po\" and variations on the word \"purchase\" solidified this. While \"Hardware\" was considered, the focus is on the procurement itself, not a hardware-related problem. The details about \"Inch Pro\" are informative, but the central action is still the purchase. So, I have finalized my selection of the \"Purchase\" category for this ticket.\n\n\n"
