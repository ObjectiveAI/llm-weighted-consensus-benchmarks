After analyzing the keywords \"upgrade users\" and \"upgrade application version,\" I'm leaning towards \"Internal Project\" or possibly \"Purchase\" if it involves software licensing. Need to weigh the context to make a definitive call on where it fits best on that spectrum.\n\n\n**Revising Category Scope**\n\nI've been re-evaluating the initial category assessment. While \"Internal Project\" initially seemed fitting, the \"administration\" and \"modify screens\" aspects are making me rethink. The user mentions \"upgrade users,\" \"upgrade application version,\" and \"administrators,\" pointing to potentially deep modification of existing systems. A broader category, such as \"Internal Project\" with added context notes, could be more apt.\n\n\n**Pinpointing Primary Focus**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the best category. Considering the text, which includes keywords like \"upgrade application version,\" \"administration,\" and \"modify screens,\" I've excluded \"Administrative rights\" as the primary focus seems broader. The ticket describes a planned application upgrade with administrators involved, solidifying \"Internal Project\" as the most suitable category. I'm satisfied.\n\n\n**Confirming Project Context**\n\nI'm solidifying the \"Internal Project\" categorization. The recent deep dive into the provided text further confirms it, particularly with mentions of sprints, epics, and backlog management, all pointing to project-based activities related to the application upgrade. The inclusion of administrator tasks is also crucial, underscoring the project's internal nature.\n\n\n**Confirming Final Selection**\n\nMy focus is now firmly on \"Internal Project.\" The detailed analysis of the provided text, particularly the project management keywords like \"sprints,\" \"epics,\" and \"backlog,\" reinforces this choice. The text also includes the phrase \"planned works\" and the upgrade of an application is inherently an internal project. While administrative aspects are present, the core of the ticket revolves around the broader scope of the software upgrade and its internal implementation.\n\n\n"
