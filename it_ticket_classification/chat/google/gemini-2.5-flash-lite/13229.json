I'm reviewing each ticket's description and mapping it to one of the provided options: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, or Administrative rights. This process ensures efficient routing and resolution.\n\n**Classifying ticket content**\n\nI'm prioritizing the \"Access\" category for this ticket due to strong mentions of enabling access for employees and managers, particularly concerning reports and shared folders. The text suggests a need for permissions or rights rather than physical items or general administrative tasks.\n\n**Refining IT ticket categorization**\n\nI've concluded that the current IT ticket strongly aligns with the \"Access\" category. My analysis focused on repeated mentions of enabling access, specifically for employees and managers, and keywords related to reports and shared folders. This leads me to believe the request is about granting permissions rather than hardware or administrative rights.\n\n"
