Based on the mention of \"azure machines\" and \"drive,\" I'm leaning towards categorizing it under \"Storage\" or potentially a broader system configuration category if one were available. The request seems to involve modifying or configuring a cloud-based resource rather than a physical one.\n\n**Revising Ticket Category**\n\nI'm refining my assessment of the IT ticket. While \"Storage\" was a consideration due to the \"drive\" mention, the core request to \"change azure machine\" is broad and could encompass more than just storage. I'm now considering \"Miscellaneous\" or potentially \"Internal Project\" as more fitting if the specific change isn't clearly tied to storage or another defined category.\n\n**Refining Category Choice**\n\nI'm continuing to analyze the ticket's core intent. While \"change azure machine\" is general, the specific mention of \"drive\" is a strong indicator. I'm concluding that modifying storage associated with an Azure virtual machine is the most probable request, leading me to categorize it as \"Storage.\"\n\n**Determining Category Assignment**\n\nI'm currently focused on classifying the IT ticket. After reviewing the description \"change azure machine change azure machine hi please make azure machines azure both drive please assign thanks design lead ext,\" and considering the available categories, my primary assessment points towards \"Storage\" due to the explicit mention of \"drive\" in relation to Azure machines.\n\n"
