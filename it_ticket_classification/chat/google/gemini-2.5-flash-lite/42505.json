                    "reasoning": "**Defining the Ticket Type**\n\nI'm currently trying to pinpoint the correct category for this IT ticket. Based on the text, \"wallet import story points column not available sent tuesday wallet import story points column available hi\", my initial leaning is towards \"Access\" or potentially \"Internal Project,\" given the mentions of \"column\" availability which can be linked to project access. I'm carefully analyzing the keywords to make a definite choice.\n\n\n**Categorizing the IT Request**\n\nI've been analyzing the text further and the \"Access\" and \"Internal Project\" categories seem less fitting. The core of this seems to revolve around a missing feature or bug within the \"wallet import\" functionality, regarding the \"story points column.\" I'm now leaning heavily towards a \"Miscellaneous\" categorization for this specific IT request.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've been going through the text again, focusing on the specific issue at hand. It seems I was initially drawn to broad categories, but the core issue is indeed the absence of the \"story points column\" during a wallet import or issues file upload. The user's request, \"please add also story points column field,\" solidifies this as a functionality-related concern rather than a simple access problem. This leans away from \"Internal Project\" as a perfect fit, given it is not directly related to the project itself.\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nI've been examining the text again, and \"Internal Project\" is still the strongest contender, if we assume the \"wallet import\" and \"story points\" relate to an internal project or tool. The user's request for the \"story points column field\" suggests a functionality gap in a system we support internally. Given the context, this seems to fit best among the provided categories.\n\n\n**Revisiting the Categorization**\n\nI'm now revisiting the \"Internal Project\" option. The core of the issue is the absence of a \"story points column\" during a wallet import or issues upload, and the user explicitly requests its addition. While I initially considered \"Miscellaneous,\" the context of \"wallet import\" and \"story points\" suggests this could be related to internal project management tools. This aligns with a requirement for functional changes within an IT-supported internal system. I'm choosing \"Internal Project\" as the best fit given the limited categories.\n\n\n**Selecting the Optimal Category**\n\nI'm now certain \"Internal Project\" is the best category. The user needs a \"story points\" column added during import or upload, implying a system enhancement within an IT-supported internal tool. This aligns with project management or development workflows. I've ruled out \"Miscellaneous\" as the request is too specific and not generic.\n\n\n**Defining the IT Ticket's Focus**\n\nI'm now certain that the \"Internal Project\" category is the most fitting. Despite initially considering \"Miscellaneous,\" the core of this request is about functionality within a specific IT-supported tool or system. I'm choosing this category, given the limited options.\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nI've been going through the text again, and \"Internal Project\" is still the strongest contender, if we assume the \"wallet import\" and \"story points\" relate to an internal project or tool.
