Based on the text \"service now keeps redirecting me...\", I'm leaning toward either \"Access\" or potentially \"Miscellaneous\". The frequent redirecting feels like an access issue, but I need more context to be sure. I'm focusing on the keywords and the overall nature of the problem.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Possibilities**\n\nI'm leaning heavily towards \"Access\" now. The text, specifically the phrase \"keeps redirecting me,\" and the mention of Service Now, strongly suggest an issue with user permissions or authentication. Although the user has attempted troubleshooting steps like clearing the cache, the core problem remains redirection, which points directly towards access control. I'm still keeping \"Miscellaneous\" as a potential fallback, but \"Access\" is the most likely category based on this analysis.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Root Cause**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and the available categories. The keyword \"redirecting\" is key, and it continues to point towards an \"Access\" issue. Though \"Administrative rights\" is relevant, the user's focus is on entering the system, implying a general access problem. My current thought is to assign \"Access\" but I'm open to further refinement.\n\n\n**Refining Category Assignment**\n\nThe keyword \"redirecting\" and \"enter\" combined with \"Service Now\" and the provided categories strongly suggests the user is experiencing a core \"Access\" issue. Their inability to bypass the redirection loop indicates an authentication or authorization problem. I'm now leaning more firmly toward \"Access\" being the best fit, as the issue clearly involves the user's attempt to gain entry or complete a standard action within the system. \"Administrative rights\" remains a possible secondary cause.\n\n\n"
