My process involves identifying key terms within the ticket descriptions to map to predefined categories such as \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" The current text includes \"create instead outlook called com wed\".\n\n\n**Categorizing the Requests**\n\nI'm identifying recurring themes and keywords within the ticket descriptions to determine the best categories. Terms like \"mailbox,\" \"permission,\" \"add,\" and \"shared\" are prevalent. The \"create shared mailbox\" phrase strongly suggests a need for \"Access\" or potentially \"Internal Project,\" depending on its intended use. I'm carefully analyzing the context to discern nuances in intent.\n\n\n**Mapping Ticket Text**\n\nI've honed in on the key terms within the ticket text. Words like \"create shared mailbox,\" \"add shared mailbox,\" \"permission,\" and \"members\" consistently point towards access management.  I've concluded that the primary focus is unquestionably on handling user access requests and mailbox configurations, solidly indicating the \"Access\" category is the best fit.\n\n\n**Determining the Best Fit**\n\nI've carefully reviewed the ticket text, focusing on the keywords.  The consistent appearance of terms like \"create shared mailbox,\" \"add shared mailbox,\" \"members,\" and \"permission\" has solidified my decision. While there are some administrative elements, the primary emphasis is unquestionably on access management. The phrases point directly to requests for user access and mailbox configurations, confirming that \"Access\" is the most precise and appropriate category for this specific IT ticket.\n\n\n"
