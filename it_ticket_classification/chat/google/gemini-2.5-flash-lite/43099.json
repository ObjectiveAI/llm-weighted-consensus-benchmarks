The wording \"duplicate notifications\" feels very system-oriented, but I'm hesitant to put it in storage or hardware based on the context. \"Hello\" and \"thank you\" seem extraneous here, so I'm honing in on the core issue: duplicate notifications.\n\n\n**Determining the Root Cause**\n\nI've been drilling down on the root of this \"duplicate notifications\" issue. The system is clearly malfunctioning, though the specific cause remains elusive. I've ruled out hardware, access, and HR support as irrelevant. \"Miscellaneous\" seems increasingly likely given the broad nature of the issue, and lack of information on what specifically is triggering the duplication. It's not a storage, purchase, or internal project issue.\n\n\n**Defining the Problem's Nature**\n\nI'm now focusing on the core issue: \"duplicate notifications.\" The \"SN\" reference remains unclear, preventing me from definitively labeling it as an \"Internal Project.\" My thinking now leans heavily towards \"Miscellaneous.\" The root cause, a system malfunction, seems the primary issue, thus solidifying my assessment.\n\n\n"
