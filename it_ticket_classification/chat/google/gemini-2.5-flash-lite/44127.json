Initial observations suggest a potential \"Access\" issue, given the mention of \"admin mode\" and the application in question, but more context is needed to confirm this. The details are a little light, and I'm looking for clear keywords or phrases to solidify this categorization.\n\n\n**Defining the Category**\n\nI've been going through the ticket details and landed on \"Access\" as the most suitable category. The user's symptoms, like \"access forbidden\" and the need to run in \"admin mode,\" strongly point to a permissions issue. I considered \"Administrative rights,\" but \"Access\" seems broader and better fits the overall problem. I'm now ready to draft a response.\n\n\n**Identifying the Core Issue**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's language, zeroing in on phrases like \"runs without admin mode\" and \"access forbidden.\" These point me towards the correct categorization. After weighing all the possibilities, \"Administrative rights\" seems to be the most fitting choice. The user clearly needs elevated privileges, as evidenced by the workarounds and error messages.\n\n\n\n"
