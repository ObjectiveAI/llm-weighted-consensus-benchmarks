Currently, I'm focusing on parsing the user's request to identify the primary category. The task involves mapping keywords and phrases within the text to the predefined categories to generate a JSON object containing the determined \"category\". I am looking at ways to determine edge cases, as the ticket may be vague.\n\n\n**Defining the Ticket's Scope**\n\nI'm continuing to classify the ticket's intent. Based on the keywords \"access,\" \"restricted tab,\" and \"client monthly report template,\" the focus seems squarely on granting or troubleshooting access to a specific resource, which points to \"Access\" as the primary category. I'll need to confirm that this is not a hardware-related issue and confirm if there are any additional sub-categories.\n\n\n**Confirming Access Classification**\n\nI've reviewed the provided ticket text and identified key phrases such as \"client monthly report template access\" and \"restricted tab,\" which firmly indicate the need for access. While there's a minor aspect of data storage with \"location where upload reports,\" the core concern is gaining or resolving access issues related to the report template. After considering all the keywords and available categories, I am confident that \"Access\" is the most accurate and precise classification, and I will output that as the primary category.\n\n\n"
