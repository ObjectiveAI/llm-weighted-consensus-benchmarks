My initial thought is it relates to \"sonar integration\", which strongly suggests a technical issue.  I am trying to determine the best categorization from the given options, and \"Access\" appears to be the most fitting based on the described need for certificates to resolve the problem.\n\n\n**Refining Category Choices**\n\nI'm now leaning heavily towards \"Internal Project\". The \"sonar integration\" issue, coupled with the certificate fix, strongly suggests this is about maintaining an internal software project's development pipeline. While \"Miscellaneous\" remains a possibility, the specific nature of the problem makes \"Internal Project\" a better, more accurate label. I'm satisfied that this is the best fit, and ready to move on.\n\n\n**Categorizing Ticket Details**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on \"Internal Project\" as the best fit. \"Sonar integration\" points towards an internal development process, reinforced by \"installing proper certificates.\" While \"Miscellaneous\" remains a possibility, the focus on a development-related tool makes \"Internal Project\" more accurate. The keywords strongly suggest this issue is related to an internal project's workflow. This aligns with the ticket's technical nature.\n\n\n**Choosing Final Categorization**\n\nI've re-evaluated the ticket.  The \"Sonar integration\" and certificate fix strongly suggest a setup or maintenance task linked to an internal development tool. Assuming Sonar is used internally, \"Internal Project\" is the best fit. I've considered \"Miscellaneous\" but it's less specific. The issue's technical nature aligns with internal development, confirming my final decision.\n\n\n**Deciding on Ticket Label**\n\nI am now focusing on the ticket's core problem, which is installing certificates to fix Sonar integration.  Based on this, and the available categorization options, \"Internal Project\" best represents a maintenance task involving an internal development tool. Although \"Miscellaneous\" is a safe option, the specific technical issue and tool context make \"Internal Project\" a more informative label for this ticket. My final decision is clear.\n\n\n"
