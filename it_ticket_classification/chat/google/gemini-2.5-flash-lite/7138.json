The user's inability to view calendars and the difficulty in booking meetings are both direct consequences of insufficient or misconfigured permissions. I initially leaned towards \"Access\" and after reviewing the user's detailed description, my assessment has not changed. I am ready to tag this ticket.\n\n\n"
