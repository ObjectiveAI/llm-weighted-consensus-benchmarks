I need to figure out which label from the predefined list best fits the provided information. At first glance, it appears to be a matter of understanding the user's intent from very limited details.\n\n\n**Analyzing Onboarding Details**\n\nIt seems clear now that the ticket's primary focus revolves around onboarding, specifically a new hire in Bogota. I've pinpointed key phrases like \"new starter,\" \"joining,\" and \"compliance officer,\" which heavily lean towards HR support. With the form also mentioned, this solidified my conclusion: the appropriate categorization is indeed \"HR Support.\"\n\n\n"
