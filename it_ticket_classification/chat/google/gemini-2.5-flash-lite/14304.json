My focus is on determining the most suitable category for it, and the mention of \"he has left\" is very relevant. \"HR Support\" seems like a strong contender based on that phrase. It's a quick analysis, but the user's focus on \"he has left\" is a clear indication for me.\n\n\n**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI've honed in on the ticket text. The phrase \"he has left\" is the key. While access might be impacted, \"HR Support\" is the clearest fit. Offboarding and account updates due to an employee's departure are the immediate implications. I've ruled out hardware, storage, purchases, and internal projects. \"Miscellaneous\" is too broad, and the need for administrative rights is secondary. \"HR Support\" appears the most suitable.\n\n\n"
