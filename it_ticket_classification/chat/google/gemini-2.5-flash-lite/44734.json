The aim is to map the description, which seems sparse (\"not working sent monday working\"), to one of the predefined categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, or Administrative rights. The keywords \"not working,\" \"sent,\" and \"working\" will be key in this categorization process.\n\n\n**Categorizing Access Issue**\n\nI've refined my approach to categorize the ticket as an \"Access\" issue. My recent analysis focused on \"being able to access self-portal\" and the \"receives error message,\" strongly indicating an access-related problem. I eliminated other categories like \"Hardware\" and \"HR Support\" because they lacked relevant keywords. \"Administrative rights\" was considered but deemed less precise than the core issue of portal access.\n\n\n"
