Considering terms like \"wallpaper roll out,\" \"screen resolutions,\" and \"updating wallpapers,\" \"Internal Project\" appears to be the most accurate classification, reflecting a planned deployment of visual updates.\n\n**Selecting Appropriate Ticket Classification**\n\nI'm solidifying my decision on the IT ticket's classification. Given the recurring themes of \"wallpaper roll out,\" \"screen resolutions,\" and \"lock screen visuals,\" I'm confidently categorizing this as an \"Internal Project\" due to its nature of planned, systematic updates and deployments.\n\n"
