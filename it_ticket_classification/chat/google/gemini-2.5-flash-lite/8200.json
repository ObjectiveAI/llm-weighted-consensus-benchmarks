The ticket describes an issue with a mailbox and stuck emails in the outbox. It sounds like a storage or email delivery problem. I'm carefully considering the options provided, leaning towards \"Storage\" as the primary concern here, though \"Miscellaneous\" is also a possible fit.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Storage Concerns**\n\nI've refined my initial assessment. The \"Storage\" category seems increasingly likely. While \"Access\" could be relevant if the user can't send, the stuck outbox and deletion issues point strongly toward potential storage limitations. I'm focusing on the core mailbox storage, and investigating how to best address this as the main issue.\n\n\n**Revising Email Issue**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket, focusing on \"large mails\" and the \"stuck outbox\" detail. My initial lean towards \"Storage\" is reinforced; a full or near-full mailbox is the likely culprit. While access is a factor in *using* the mailbox, the problem's root lies in storage constraints, causing delivery failure and deletion issues. I'm confirming this is the correct classification.\n\n\n"
