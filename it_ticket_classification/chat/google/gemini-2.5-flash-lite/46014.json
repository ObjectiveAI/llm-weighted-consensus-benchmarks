I've considered several categories, but the \"build error\" and \"slave promote\" language points strongly towards a technical issue. I'm leaning towards \"Hardware,\" \"Storage,\" or \"Internal Project.\" My analysis is zeroing in on resolving this ambiguity.\n\n\n**Confirming Storage Issues**\n\nI've honed in on the ticket's core problem: build failures due to disk space limitations. The \"build error,\" \"disk usage,\" and \"connection timed out\" clues are decisive. My analysis has confirmed a definitive link to storage constraints. I'm confident in categorizing it under \"Storage\". My earlier options, such as \"Hardware\" and \"Internal Project,\" are now considered secondary.\n\n\n"
