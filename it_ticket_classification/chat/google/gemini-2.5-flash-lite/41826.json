The mention of \"zone nomination\" and the involvement of line manager approval strongly suggest this. I'm leaning towards \"Access,\" but I'm keeping the other options in mind to make sure. I'll need to make sure none are better.\n\n\n**Evaluating Category Choice**\n\n\\n\\nI've now narrowed down the ticket's ideal category to \"HR Support.\" My thinking leans toward this choice because the phrases used are HR-process related. However, I'm still trying to confirm if \"Access\" is a better fit. The nomination process could be linked to system access, but the crux of the issue seems to be a workflow interruption. I'm exploring how vacation planning might integrate with this nomination and approval process.\n\n\n"
