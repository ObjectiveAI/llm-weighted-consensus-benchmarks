The phrase \"new purchase request\" immediately suggests a \"Purchase\" category. The other elements in the text don't seem to contradict this initial assessment, confirming my decision.\n\n\n**Pinpointing Key Indicators**\n\nI've carefully examined the text and identified several key phrases pointing toward the \"Purchase\" category. Terms like \"purchase request,\" \"purchase coordinator,\" and \"resale item\" leave little room for ambiguity. Specific items mentioned, such as \"monitor keyboard,\" further solidify this determination. Based on this thorough analysis, I am confident in my categorization.\n\n\n"
