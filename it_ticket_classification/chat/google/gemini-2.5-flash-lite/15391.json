The text mentions a \"new starter file share\" and a \"joiner\".  I'm leaning towards a few possibilities, namely \"Access\" or potentially \"HR Support\", but I need to make a solid selection. I am considering whether the \"joiner\" aspect is more relevant to HR or Access.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Best Fit**\n\nI'm now focusing on how the \"joiner\" aspect plays into the categorization. It seems the \"new starter file share\" points more strongly towards \"Access,\" but I am also weighing how the \"joiner\" aspect is closely tied to HR onboarding. I'm leaning toward a combined approach, perhaps prioritizing \"HR Support\" with a note about access required. Still, I must be certain.\n\n\n**Deciding the Primary Category**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the best fit for this ticket. The \"new starter file share\" aspect still keeps leading me toward \"HR Support\". While \"Access\" is relevant, the core issue is the onboarding of a new employee, which is the province of HR. I'm solidifying my rationale: This ticket is about fulfilling an HR function through IT assistance.\n\n\n**Concluding on the Best Category**\n\nI've finally reached a firm decision. After carefully reviewing the ticket's language (\"new starter file share\" and the context of a \"joiner\"), \"HR Support\" emerges as the most appropriate category. My rationale is that the ticket centers around an HR function: onboarding a new employee. Although \"Access\" is involved, it's a sub-task within the broader process of supporting the new starter. Therefore, \"HR Support\" provides the most holistic and accurate representation of the request's core purpose.\n\n\n"
