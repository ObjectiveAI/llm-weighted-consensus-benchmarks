I've broken down the provided text, looking for keywords that suggest the type of issue. The terms don't clearly map to a single category yet, and I'm still analyzing to see if any context could help narrow it down further. I'm focusing on the terms that might indicate the kind of support needed, so I can match them with the list: \"Hardware|HR Support|Access|Miscellaneous|Storage|Purchase|Internal Project|Administrative rights\".\n\n\n**Categorizing the Project Issue**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and the available categories. \"Project Management\" is the most frequent term. \"Tabs,\" \"change tab menu,\" and \"code\" further point toward an internal project. While the ticket touches on UI elements and searching, the core seems to be development or management of a project, making \"Internal Project\" the most likely category. The phrases \"query\" and \"searched\" support that assumption.\n\n\n**Defining Ticket Classification**\n\nI've been examining the text and the available categories to classify the IT ticket. The keywords \"project management,\" \"tabs,\" \"change tab menu,\" \"code,\" and \"searched\" strongly suggest the issue pertains to an internal project. While the ticket involves UI elements and query capabilities, the central focus aligns with the development or management of a project, making \"Internal Project\" the most suitable category.\n\n\n"
