The recurring \"leaver form\" and \"disable cards\" strongly suggest this pertains to employee departures, aligning it best with \"HR Support\" rather than just \"Hardware\" or \"Access.\"\n\n**Refining Category Selection**\n\nI'm re-evaluating the ticket's categorization. While \"leaver hardware\" and \"disable cards\" touch on specific aspects, the recurring \"leaver form\" strongly suggests an HR-driven offboarding process. Therefore, \"HR Support\" appears to be the most encompassing and accurate classification for this request.\n\n**Processing Leaver Ticket**\n\nI'm currently classifying an IT ticket. The recurring mention of \"leaver form\" alongside \"leaver hardware\" and \"disable cards\" suggests a comprehensive employee offboarding request, making \"HR Support\" the most fitting category.\n\n"
