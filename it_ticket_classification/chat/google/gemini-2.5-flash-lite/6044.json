My initial thought is it relates to onboarding or access. The phrasing is vague, so more context is needed. I'm leaning toward \"Access\" or potentially \"HR Support\", but need to analyze further to rule out \"Internal Project\".\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Optimal Category**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and am leaning towards \"HR Support\". The phrase \"new starter\" appears prominently, along with mentions of \"starter forms\" and \"starting date\". My thinking is that the ticket likely concerns the onboarding process, rather than a specific technical issue. Granting access is part of it, but the broader \"HR Support\" category fits better, since it encompasses the setup needed for a \"new starter\".\n\n\n**Confirming Category Choice**\n\nI've solidified my stance on \"HR Support\" as the ideal category for the ticket. My reasoning centers on the prominent \"new starter\" and \"starter forms\" keywords, which point towards a broader HR onboarding process. It's more than just access, it is the full process of integrating a new employee, which aligns well with the \"HR Support\" label.\n\n\n"
