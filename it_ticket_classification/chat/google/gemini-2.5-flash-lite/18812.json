                    "reasoning": "**Categorizing Ticket: Ongoing**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the text. My focus is on the phrase \"change admin.\" I need to determine the most relevant category from the list. It feels like \"Administrative rights\" is the most fitting choice, as it directly relates to modifying administrative privileges.\n\n\n**Defining Scope: Refinement**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the text, seeking the core issue. I'm leaning toward \"Administrative rights\" as the primary category, but now I'm thinking I might need a secondary tag, perhaps something related to \"Internal Project\" or \"Access\", as the ticket also involves location-specific changes and potential content updates. The keyword \"change admin\" is definitely the strongest indicator, but the other phrases are relevant too. I need to be sure I choose the best possible primary and secondary tags.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've been drilling down on the text, homing in on the \"change admin\" portion. It's becoming clearer that \"Administrative rights\" is the central concern. I'm now weighing the inclusion of \"Internal Project\" or \"Access\" as a secondary category. Although phrases like \"update content\" and \"assign\" are relevant, the emphasis lies squarely on modification of administrative privileges.\n\n\n**Revisiting Category Choices**\n\nI'm now thoroughly examining the text again. After the last thought, I need to choose between *Administrative rights* and *Internal Project*. \"Change admin\" and \"assign\" are the central commands, but the mention of a \"backlog,\" \"task,\" and \"finalized during weeks\" hints at the implementation being part of a larger project. I am now leaning slightly toward *Internal Project* as the primary category and *Administrative rights* as the secondary. It seems the project itself is about administrative changes.\n\n\n**Categorizing Project: Prioritized**\n\nI'm now focusing on the phrase \"task currently backlog\". It's leading me to think that \"Internal Project\" is the primary category, with \"Administrative rights\" as secondary. The ticket seems to describe a project involving administrative changes, not just a single access issue. The recent thoughts about prioritization are really helping to focus.\n\n\n**Analyzing IT Ticket: Final Decision**\n\nI'm now concluding that \"Internal Project\" best captures the essence of this ticket. While \"Administrative rights\" is a key component, the focus is on a structured initiative to modify and assign administrative roles. Phrases like \"task currently backlog,\" \"finalized during weeks,\" and \"identify owners\" strongly suggest this is a project, not just a single access request. \"Administrative rights\" is now determined to be a secondary tag.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Ticket: Final Decision**\n\nI'm now concluding that \"Internal Project\" is the primary category for this ticket, and \"Administrative rights\" is the secondary. While the core action involves admin changes, the ticket's language (\"backlog\", \"weeks\", \"owners\") strongly implies a structured project to manage and assign administrative roles across locations. It's a project to change administrative access, not simply a request to change access.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Project: Final Decision**\n\nNow, I'm confident that the core of this ticket is an **Internal Project**. The language regarding tasks, backlogs, and timelines underscores that. While admin rights are at play, the request is for help with a structured project to manage and assign administrative roles, not just a simple access change.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Project: Final Decision**\n\nI'm now confident that the core of this ticket is an **Internal Project**.
