After analyzing the text (\"does not display any members team does display any members\"), it seems the core issue revolves around access, likely related to a team's membership visibility. Therefore, I'm leaning toward selecting the \"Access\" category, as it seems the most relevant.\n\n\n**Re-evaluating Categories**\n\nI'm reassessing the best category. While \"Access\" seemed initially appropriate, now I think **HR Support** is a better fit. The ticket's focus on \"career listed section,\" \"objectives,\" and \"feedback categories\" all point towards HR functions, likely within an internal system. The issue seems to be functional, not just access-related. I will finalize and refine the categorization decision.\n\n\n**Confirming HR Relevance**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's content again. Focusing on the \"career listed section\", \"objectives,\" and \"feedback categories\" language solidified my conclusion. It's not about simple access but more about how this system functions for managing and providing employee information. \"HR Support\" appears the clear winner, reflecting the ticket's core issue, which relates to an HR system's features.\n\n\n"
