So, now I need to determine where that falls.\n\n\n**Defining Ticket Type**\n\nI've examined the ticket content and analyzed the core requests for \"usage reports\" and \"assign requests.\" I am still working through the best category for this ticket. While Storage could potentially be relevant, the text is not specific. I'm leaning toward \"Miscellaneous,\" as the ticket's general nature doesn't align with the other defined categories. I need to make sure I am making the correct assignment.\n\n\n"
