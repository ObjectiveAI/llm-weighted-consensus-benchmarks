I'm focusing on the keywords to refine the best fit.\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nMy focus has shifted slightly, considering the overlap between \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights.\" The \"teams\" mention nudged me to consider Teams-specific permissions, a strong pointer towards access or potentially administrative rights. The 'folder' aspect makes me consider file permissions, solidifying the idea that this is an Access issue that may involve Administrative rights.  I'm now weighing the nuances of these two categories to determine the best fit.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Issue**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on \"Access\" as the primary category. The phrase \"cannot add additional rights\" is the deciding factor; it indicates a request for *access*, rather than an administrator setting permissions. The Teams mention, while potentially relevant, further supports the idea of access within a specific platform. My refined understanding is this is a user reporting a lack of access, not an administrative issue with the configuration.\n\n\n**Determining the Best Fit**\n\nI've been going through the analysis, and the emphasis on the \"cannot add\" portion is leading me to the conclusion that this falls under \"Access\". Considering the user's struggle to *gain* the rights, it's more aligned with \"Access\" than with administrative setup issues. While administrative tasks are implied, the reported problem is the user's lack of permission.\n\n\n"
