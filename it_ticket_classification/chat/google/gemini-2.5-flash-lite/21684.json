My analysis of the keywords and context strongly indicates an access-related request, specifically concerning project folders and Git repositories, rather than hardware or general administrative issues.\n\n**Finding Ticket Classification**\n\nI've reviewed the provided text and have now determined the most suitable category for the IT ticket.
