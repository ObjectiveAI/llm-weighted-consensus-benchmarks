Considering the options, it seems most likely falls under \"HR Support\", although further context is always needed. I will keep analyzing the text to confirm.\n\n\n**Narrowing the Focus**\n\nIt looks like I've made significant progress in pinpointing the most appropriate category for the IT ticket. Considering the \"new starter,\" \"starter form,\" and \"completed form,\" the onboarding process seems key. While \"Access\" is a possibility, I believe \"HR Support\" is the best fit, as the issue appears more about the form and process than just access permissions. I've ruled out the remaining options as not directly relevant to this situation.\n\n\n"
