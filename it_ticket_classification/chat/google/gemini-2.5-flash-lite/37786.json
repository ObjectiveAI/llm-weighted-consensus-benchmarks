The user can't change a line manager, which leads me to believe this falls under \"HR Support\" or potentially \"Administrative rights\" if those permissions are the issue. I'm leaning towards \"HR Support\" as the more probable primary category, but I'll verify it's not a permissions issue.\n\n\n**Clarifying Ticket's Nature**\n\nI'm solidifying my assessment of the IT ticket. After a careful review, \"HR Support\" appears the most accurate category. While \"Administrative rights\" was considered, the root problem concerns the line manager change process, not just access. \"HR Support\" aligns better with the core issue of employee data management and organizational structure changes.\n\n\n"
