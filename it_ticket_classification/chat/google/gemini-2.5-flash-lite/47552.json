I'm weighing whether \"Internal Project\" or something more specific like \"Administrative Rights\" is the correct classification. The \"contracts below\" phrasing will factor in, too.\n\n\n**Narrowing the Classification**\n\nI've decided to refine the category based on the ticket details. The phrase \"urgent internal audit request\" is critical here. It seems the \"Access\" option is the best fit, given the user wants to \"view approvals\" and \"grant access\". The focus is on the permission needed, specifically tied to this audit. The \"old system\" aspect doesn't seem to warrant a different categorization.\n\n\n"
