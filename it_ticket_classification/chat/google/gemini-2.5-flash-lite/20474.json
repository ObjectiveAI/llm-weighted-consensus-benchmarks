I am leaning towards \"HR Support\" or \"Access\" as potential fits, given the mention of a \"new starter\" and location references. However, the lack of detail makes a definitive assignment tricky. Further analysis of context could be helpful.\n\n\n**Analyzing Ticket Details**\n\nI've been drilling down into the specifics of this ticket. \"New starter\" is the key. The location/date data seems secondary, but is helpful. While \"Access\" is still in the running, the request to \"fill attached date\" feels more HR-related, suggesting the need to onboard the new starter within the HR system.\n\n\n**Determining Ticket Origin**\n\nI'm now fully committed to classifying this ticket as \"HR Support.\" It seems clearer now. The \"new starter\" context, combined with the request to fill in a date, solidifies the focus on employee onboarding. I feel more confident in that conclusion.\n\n\n**Prioritizing HR Focus**\n\nNow, I'm firmly settled on \"HR Support.\" The \"new starter\" trigger feels definitive, and the \"fill attached date\" instruction firmly supports it. The context points to an onboarding task, better suited for HR than Access. The IT aspects are service-level, while HR initiates the need.\n\n```json\n{\n\"category\": \"HR Support\"\n}\n```\n\n\n"
