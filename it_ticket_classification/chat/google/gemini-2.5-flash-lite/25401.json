Analyzing the text, I'm leaning toward \"Internal Project\" due to the mention of \"pm change\" multiple times, suggesting a project or task involving project management. However, I'm still considering other options to ensure the most precise categorization.\n\n\n**Revising Category Choice**\n\nAfter reviewing the ticket again and the categories, I'm leaning toward \"Administrative rights.\" The phrase \"pm change for oracle\" suggests that a permission, role, or some kind of authorization tied to Oracle might need adjustment. \"pm\" could very well be a permission level or related to administrative access within that system.\n\n\n**Narrowing the Categorization**\n\nI've decided to refine my focus to the ambiguity surrounding \"pm.\" The phrase suggests modifications related to access or permissions within Oracle. Taking into account the phrase \"administrative rights\" seems the most accurate categorization. I've ruled out \"Internal Project\" as the focus is less on a broad project and more on an adjustment to a specific access level.\n\n**Solidifying Category Decision**\n\nI've decided to move forward with categorizing this ticket under \"Administrative rights.\" The repetitive use of \"pm change\" coupled with \"for oracle\" and \"assigned pm\" strengthens the connection to adjustments concerning roles or permissions within the Oracle system. Given this context, \"Administrative rights\" is far more appropriate than general access changes. I'm now certain that this categorization best represents the focus of the IT request.\n\n\n"
