The provided text, with its mention of \"feedback\" and a \"question,\" doesn't clearly fall into the given IT categories. My current process is to analyze the keywords within the ticket, perhaps identifying a more precise option. I am looking for a suitable fit from the list. I am leaning toward \"miscellaneous\" for now.\n\n\n**Evaluating Further Categories**\n\nI'm now re-evaluating the IT ticket's content and its implications for category assignment. Considering the new internal project focus and the feedback tool that is the subject of this ticket, \"Internal Project\" now seems like a better fit than \"Miscellaneous.\" This update is based on the keywords and the apparent task being described. I am leaning towards this category, as the focus is an internal process of feedback.\n\n\n**Refining Category Choice**\n\nI'm now revisiting the \"Internal Project\" categorization. The ticket's content, emphasizing \"feedback question\" and \"saved template,\" solidifies its connection to an internal system or tool. The user is clearly seeking assistance related to an internal process. I'm focusing on \"Internal Project,\" given the context of the feedback tool and its related queries, which clearly fit this category, and the prior consideration of alternatives has further cemented this conclusion.\n\n\n"
