After analyzing the text (\"new starter new jersey friday pm re\"), I'm leaning toward \"HR Support\" due to the mention of a \"new starter.\" I'm evaluating this further to rule out any other possibilities like \"Access\" if it pertains to onboarding.\n\n\n**Narrowing Access Concerns**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on \"Access\" as the prime category. The text highlights several access-related elements: user account creation (\"ad has created user name\"), granting credentials, and potentially providing image access. While HR is involved in new employee setup, the technical task is fundamentally about access provisioning within our system. This is an IT-centric access request, so I'm finalizing \"Access\".\n\n\n**Defining Initial Access Scope**\n\nI'm revisiting the ticket to solidify the \"Access\" classification. After assessing the text (\"new starter new jersey friday pm re\"), it is clear that the request encompasses essential access elements - creating user accounts, establishing credentials, and addressing potential image access issues. While \"HR Support\" has its place in onboarding, this request's core centers around IT access provisioning for a new employee. Therefore, it solidifies as an access-related task.\n\n\n"
