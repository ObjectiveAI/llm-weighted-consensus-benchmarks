My thought process is centered around identifying keywords within the description that directly map to the provided categories like \"leavers\" suggesting \"HR Support.\"\n\n**Assigning Ticket Categories**\n\nI'm analyzing the IT ticket details, focusing on keywords related to employee onboarding and offboarding. The terms \"leavers,\" \"leaver form,\" and \"starter form\" strongly indicate an \"HR Support\" categorization, as these are core HR processes. \"Create accounts\" also points towards \"Access,\" a task often initiated by HR actions.\n\n**Identifying HR and Access Needs**\n\nI'm now considering the interplay between HR processes and access provisioning. Keywords like \"leavers,\" \"leaver form,\" and \"starter form\" strongly signal HR Support, while \"create accounts\" points directly to Access. The context of interns complicates this slightly, as both are likely involved.\n\n**Determining Primary Category**\n\nI'm currently assessing the primary driver for the IT ticket. While \"create accounts\" points to Access and \"hardware pointed\" to Hardware, the overwhelming presence of \"leavers,\" \"leaver form,\" and \"starter form\" strongly indicates that HR Support is the most fitting category, as these are fundamentally HR-driven processes.\n\n"
