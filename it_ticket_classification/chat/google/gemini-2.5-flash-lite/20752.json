While installation might point towards \"Administrative rights\", the emphasis is on a new asset. I need to balance the options before solidifying a category. I believe the ticket is pointing towards the \"Purchase\" category.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Purchase Intent**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the ticket text, zeroing in on the \"new purchase\" indicator. While \"pro retina intel kb\" hints at hardware, the core action seems to revolve around acquisition. Re-evaluating, the \"Purchase\" category appears to be the most fitting based on the overall context, as the request is centered around the purchase of hardware.\n\n\n**Finalizing Purchase Categorization**\n\nMy focus remains firmly on the \"new purchase\" language within the ticket, solidifying my categorization. Although hardware specifics like \"pro retina intel kb\" are present, the core request revolves around the acquisition of new hardware. While considering \"Hardware\" initially, the action's focus on procurement confirms \"Purchase\" as the most precise category. \"Installation\" is likely part of the purchasing process, not the primary intent.\n\n\n"
