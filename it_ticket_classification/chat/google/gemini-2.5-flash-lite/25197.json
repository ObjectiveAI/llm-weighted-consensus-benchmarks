The presence of \"active directory\" and \"starter form\" is pointing me towards Access or HR Support, leaning towards the former.\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the best category. My analysis of the keywords (\"new starter,\" \"active directory,\" \"starter form\") has firmly placed me between \"Access\" and \"HR Support.\" While HR is involved in onboarding, the \"active directory\" component points decisively toward the technical setup of user accounts and permissions, making \"Access\" the most accurate fit. I've eliminated less-relevant options, solidifying my choice.\n\n\n**Solidifying the Access Focus**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the ticket text and it's crystal clear that the primary action requested is providing a new employee with access. I've considered all the clues within the provided information, and the \"active directory\" component is what tips the scale toward \"Access.\" While \"HR Support\" has its merits, the technical nature of setting up the Active Directory account makes \"Access\" the indisputable champion.\n\n\n"
