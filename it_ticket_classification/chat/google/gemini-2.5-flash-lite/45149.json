It involves a new employee and focuses on access rights, as well as their processing credentials. Initially, I'm leaning toward \"Access\" and \"HR Support,\" but need to ensure nothing else is applicable. I'll need to check if there is an issue with the hardware, before I narrow down the issue.\n\n\n**Defining the Ticket Category**\n\nI've determined that \"Access\" is the most fitting category for this ticket, given the focus on a new employee's access rights and credentials. The phrasing within the text, \"access rights\" and \"process his credentials,\" aligns perfectly with the \"Access\" category. I considered \"Administrative rights,\" but it's a subset of the broader \"Access\" theme. While \"HR Support\" has contextual relevance, IT is explicitly handling the access-related request.\n\n\n"
