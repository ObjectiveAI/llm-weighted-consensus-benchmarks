After analyzing the phrase \"document purchase order requisition implemented,\" I'm leaning toward the \"Purchase\" category. It seems directly related to procurement processes. I'll need to confirm that this is the best fit, ensuring it's not more related to a different aspect like storage.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Best Fit**\n\nI'm confident the category is \"Purchase.\" The text consistently centers on the process of requisitioning and purchasing an item. The specifics of the purchase order details solidify this. While installation is mentioned, the core issue remains the purchase itself, not the installation.\n\n\n**Categorizing Ticket Successfully**\n\nThe choice of \"Purchase\" seems increasingly definitive. After thoroughly dissecting the phrase and associated details, the core request is undoubtedly centered around the procurement process. It encompasses the item request, the requisition, the approval workflow, and the purchase order details. Installation is mentioned as a subsequent step, but the ticket's essence is the acquisition itself. This aligns well with the \"Purchase\" category, which accurately reflects the focus.\n\n\n"
