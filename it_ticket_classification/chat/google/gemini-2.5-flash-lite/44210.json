I'll need to double-check to make sure it's the right fit.\n\n\n**Categorizing the IT Request**\n\nI've determined that \"Hardware\" is the most fitting category for the ticket. The text centers on a defective network cable that needs replacement, aligning with physical equipment issues. I reviewed all categories, eliminating those that didn't apply. I've confirmed that the core need is a hardware solution.\n\n\n"
