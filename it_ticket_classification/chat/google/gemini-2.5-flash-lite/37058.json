The user's description of needing a laptop to replace a PC is leading me toward \"Purchase,\" as it involves acquiring new hardware. The mention of specific job functions might sway me toward \"HR Support\" or \"Internal Project,\" but \"Purchase\" seems to best capture the essence of the request.\n\n\n**Defining Ticket Classification**\n\nI've moved on from \"Purchase\" and am now leaning towards \"Hardware.\" This feels like the most fitting category, given the explicit focus on replacing a PC with a laptop. The specific mention of laptop models and functional needs strongly supports this classification. The request isn't primarily about purchase, HR issues, access, or internal projects. My analysis focused on the core function.\n\n\n"
