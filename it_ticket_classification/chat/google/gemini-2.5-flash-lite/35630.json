I've narrowed down the options, but am deliberating between \"Access\" and \"Miscellaneous,\" given the nature of the reported connection errors. My inclination is towards \"Access,\" as the issue seems to stem from a problem reaching the secure site.\n\n\n**Refining Access Definition**\n\nI'm now further refining my understanding of the \"Access\" category within the IT context, given the specifics of the ticket. The core issue is secure connectivity and certificate-related problems for external clients attempting to join meetings, so I'm leaning toward \"Access\" for categorization. It's becoming clearer this is about external access to a meeting platform, rather than a more general IT issue.\n\n\n**Confirming Ticket Classification**\n\nHaving analyzed the ticket description focusing on external client connectivity and certificate issues, I've confirmed my initial assessment. Despite the somewhat unclear wording, the core problem is a secure access issue. The certificate errors directly impede external clients' ability to join meetings, making \"Access\" the most appropriate category. Though a \"Network\" or \"Security\" category would be ideal, \"Access\" best encompasses the issue's essence within the available options.\n\n\n"
