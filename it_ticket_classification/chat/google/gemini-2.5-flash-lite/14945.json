My goal is to pinpoint the most accurate classification for this specific IT request.\n\n\n**Determining Ticket Origin**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the \"HR Support\" category, given the keywords \"new starter\" and \"starter form.\" I see that the form's purpose aligns perfectly with HR procedures in an onboarding process, even if IT has to assist with some of it. I'm excluding \"Access\" because while relevant, the *request* itself feels directly HR-oriented. This is my working hypothesis.\n\n\n**Revising Category Choice**\n\nNow, I'm analyzing the ticket text which solidifies my preference for \"HR Support\" due to the keywords relating to new starter procedures and their associated form. \"Access\" is still a contender but the request centers on initiating or completing the starter form process, and the *form* seems to be at the heart of the ticket. I am leaning strongly towards \"HR Support.\"\n\n\n"
