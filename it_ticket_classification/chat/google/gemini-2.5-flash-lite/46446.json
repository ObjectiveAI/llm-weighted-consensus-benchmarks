The \"constantly asking for credentials\" aspect strongly suggests an issue related to access. \"Digital cell\" might be a red herring, or it could be related to access as well, but it's less clear. Based on the phrasing so far, I'm leaning toward \"Access\" being the best fit from the provided options.\n\n\n**Analyzing Access Points**\n\nI've honed in on \"Access\" as the primary category. The repeated credential prompts are a dead giveaway. While \"Administrative rights\" could be relevant, the broader implications of access issues make the initial category the most appropriate, and I'm sticking with it. The mention of \"digital cell\" is still nebulous, but the core issue is authentication.\n\n\n"
