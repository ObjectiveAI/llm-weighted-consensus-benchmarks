The terms \"timecards,\" \"problems,\" and \"entries\" are recurring, but the phrase \"sorry delayed\" suggests a possible workflow issue. I'm leaning toward HR Support or Internal Project, but still need to determine the primary concern to offer a precise classification.\n\n\n**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI've determined that HR Support is the most fitting category. The ticket text strongly suggests issues tied to the timecard system and data entry. Phrases like \"wrong entries\" and \"problems entries\" align with HR processes. While Internal Project is a possibility, the focus is more on correcting data within an existing system, so HR Support seems more specific. The ticket doesn't seem to relate to any of the other categories.\n\n\n**Identifying Root Cause**\n\nI've determined the issue clearly revolves around incorrect timecard entries. The text highlights a delayed submission due to \"wrong entries\" and missing data (\"help days empty\"). This is pointing to a workflow problem within the timecard system, likely an error in entering or processing data. The user needs guidance on correcting or completing these entries.\n\n\n"
