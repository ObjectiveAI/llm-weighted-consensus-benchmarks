I'm focusing on keywords like \"oracle report\" and \"submitted approved time,\" and the reference to \"days need\" to guide my decision. I need to make sure the selected category accurately reflects the nature of the issue.\n\n\n**Narrowing Category Choices**\n\nI've been evaluating the ticket text. Based on keywords and context, I've eliminated most categories. I initially considered \"Access\" due to potential access issues, but the data focus points towards \"HR Support.\" It involves employee time, submissions, and approvals. The Oracle report reference solidifies my thinking, and I'm confident in my selection now.\n\n\n"
