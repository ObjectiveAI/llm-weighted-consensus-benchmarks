I'll analyze the ticket's description and match it to one of the defined categories: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" The goal is accurate classification.\n\n\n**Defining Leaver Classification**\n\nI'm focusing now on categorizing IT tickets related to departing employees. Initial analysis of provided descriptions indicates a strong emphasis on access management, administrative rights adjustments, and HR-related tasks. I'm refining the classification schema to better encompass these nuances and avoid miscategorization. This includes recognizing recurring keywords and phrases indicative of leaver processes.\n\n\n**Classifying Ticket: Leaver**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on classifying this specific ticket. The descriptions clearly outline a situation involving a departing employee and the associated IT tasks. I've considered categories like \"Access,\" \"Administrative Rights,\" and \"HR Support,\" but it's shaping up to be more of an HR process, though IT is involved in fulfilling that process. Many keywords point towards a leaver, and associated tasks like mailbox access, AD rights, phone subscriptions, and profile management. I will ultimately classify this as an \"HR Support\" ticket.\n\n\n**Revisiting Classification: HR**\n\nI'm now finalizing the classification, reinforcing my decision to assign the ticket to \"HR Support.\" The recurring presence of the term \"leaver\" and the explicit mention of a \"leaver form\" solidify this categorization. The associated IT tasks, while relevant, are ancillary to the core HR-driven process. The emphasis on access management, mailbox management, phone subscriptions, and profile management for an exiting employee strongly supports \"HR Support.\"\n\n\n"
