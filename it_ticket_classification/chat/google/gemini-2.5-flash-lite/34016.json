The text is quite fragmented, making it hard to pinpoint the issue. I'm leaning towards \"HR Support\" or \"Miscellaneous\" based on the mentions of \"approver\" and \"late submissions,\" but I need more information for a definitive answer. I'm exploring different word combinations and potential implied meanings to refine the categorization.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Category**\n\nI've honed in on \"HR Support\" as the most likely category. The phrases \"has left\" and \"deactivated\" are strong indicators of an employee departure, solidifying this choice. While the ticket is still somewhat vague, this conclusion seems the most defensible based on the available data. I am comfortable that the ticket is likely related to HR matters and not the other provided categories.\n\n\n"
