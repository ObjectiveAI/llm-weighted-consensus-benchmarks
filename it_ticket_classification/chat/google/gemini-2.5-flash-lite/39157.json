Initially, I'm leaning toward 'Access' due to the mention of \"area access\" and \"door.\" However, \"restricted area\" and \"card\" raise a bit of a question. Now I'm considering the possibility that \"Hardware\" could be relevant as well.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've carefully dissected the ticket text, isolating key phrases like \"restricted area,\" \"area access,\" and \"access card.\" The recurring theme revolves around unauthorized entry or access issues. My analysis firmly supports classifying this as an \"Access\" ticket, as it precisely addresses access control concerns. No other category in the schema seems to be a better fit.\n\n\n"
