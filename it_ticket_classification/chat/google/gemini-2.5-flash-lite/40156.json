My focus is on understanding the nature of the issue presented and matching it against the allowed options: \"Hardware\", \"HR Support\", \"Access\", \"Miscellaneous\", \"Storage\", \"Purchase\", \"Internal Project\", and \"Administrative rights.\" The goal is accurate classification.\n\n\n**Evaluating Potential Matches**\n\nRight now, I'm carefully analyzing the ticket content, focusing on the core problem: the inability to open any documents. Considering potential causes, I'm leaning toward \"Access,\" \"Storage,\" or potentially even \"Miscellaneous.\" While \"Hardware\" is possible, the ticket doesn't pinpoint a device failure. The presence of an \"error message\" suggests something more specific than a general hardware issue.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Possibilities**\n\nI'm now focusing on differentiating between storage-related problems and access issues. While both could cause document opening failures, the \"error message\" hint makes me lean toward storage. If access was the main issue, the system would likely explicitly deny access, not present an error specifically tied to document loading. The broad \"cannot open any documents\" statement strengthens the likelihood of a systemic storage issue.\n\n\n**Determining the Best Fit**\n\nOkay, I'm now certain that \"Storage\" is the best fit for this ticket. The phrasing \"cannot open any documents\" strongly suggests an underlying storage-related problem. The absence of details regarding a particular device or permissions strengthens this classification. My reasoning is that it's more of a data accessibility and integrity issue, making \"Storage\" the logical choice.\n\n\n"
