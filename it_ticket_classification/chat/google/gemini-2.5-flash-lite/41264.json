My aim is to discern the underlying problem and accurately map it to one of the defined categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, or Administrative rights. The presence of \"external user\" is a key data point.\n\n\n**Confirming Access Classification**\n\nI've analyzed the ticket text focusing on recurring phrases, specifically identifying \"external user access\" as the dominant theme. The consistent requests for access provision and the recurring use of the term \"access\" have led me to conclusively categorize the ticket under \"Access.\" This seems to be the right fit since the core of the request consistently involves granting external users access to our resources, which aligns well with the Access category.\n\n\n"
