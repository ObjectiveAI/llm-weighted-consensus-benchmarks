I'm cross-referencing these findings with the provided list of potential categories to solidify this classification.\n\n**Identifying Ticket Classification**\n\nI've thoroughly reviewed the ticket's content, and the consistent emphasis on \"permissions,\" \"rights,\" and accessing \"folders and files\" leads me to conclude with high confidence that this falls squarely under the \"Access\" category.\n\n"
