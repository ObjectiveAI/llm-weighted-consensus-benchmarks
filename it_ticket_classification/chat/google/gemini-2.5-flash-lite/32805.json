The presence of a \"design lead\" further suggests a project context.\n\n**Processing Ticket Information**\n\nI'm reviewing the provided ticket description, specifically looking at phrases like \"client ask change\" and \"stop plan\" to determine the best category from \"Hardware\", \"HR Support\", \"Access\", \"Miscellaneous\", \"Storage\", \"Purchase\", \"Internal Project\", and \"Administrative rights\". The mention of a \"design lead\" and client-driven changes points towards an \"Internal Project\" classification.\n\n**Assigning Ticket Category**\n\nI'm currently categorizing the IT ticket, focusing on key phrases like \"client ask change\" and \"stop plan.\" The mention of a \"design lead\" and the nature of the requests, relating to managing an \"instance,\" strongly suggest this ticket pertains to an **Internal Project**.\n\n**Classifying Service Requests**\n\nI'm currently processing the ticket description, focusing on keywords like \"client ask change\" and \"stop plan\" within the context of managing an \"instance.\" The mention of a \"design lead\" strongly suggests this ticket relates to an **Internal Project** rather than the other available categories.\n\n**Assigning Ticket Category**\n\nI'm currently categorizing the IT ticket, focusing on key phrases like \"client ask change\" and \"stop plan.\" The mention of a \"design lead\" and the nature of the requests, relating to managing an \"instance,\" strongly suggest this ticket pertains to an **Internal Project**.\n\n**Processing Ticket Data**\n\nI'm reviewing the IT ticket description, looking for keywords and phrases like \"instance,\" \"client ask change,\" and \"stop plan.\" The mention of a \"design lead\" suggests this request is related to an ongoing development or deployment effort, leading me to classify it as an **Internal Project**.\n\n**Processing Ticket Data**\n\nI'm reviewing the IT ticket description, looking for keywords and phrases like \"instance,\" \"client ask change,\" and \"stop plan.\" The mention of a \"design lead\" suggests this request is related to an ongoing development or deployment effort, leading me to classify it as an **Internal Project**.\n\n**Assigning Ticket Category**\n\nI'm currently categorizing the IT ticket, focusing on key phrases like \"client ask change\" and \"stop plan.\" The mention of a \"design lead\" and the nature of the requests, relating to managing an \"instance,\" strongly suggest this ticket pertains to an **Internal Project**.\n\n"
