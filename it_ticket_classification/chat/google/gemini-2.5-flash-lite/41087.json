The phrase \"issue submitting expenses\" suggests a potential payroll or expense-related problem. I'm considering other categories, but the HR context feels the most fitting so far.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Best Fit**\n\nI'm now focusing on the phrase \"following error believe connected but how change\". It makes me lean towards \"Access\" as a possibility, but since the core problem is about submission, \"HR Support\" still makes the most sense. The issue is likely connected to a system related to expenses. The user also requests assistance, which fits.\n\n\n**Reaching a Conclusion**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket text and the available categories. \"Issue submitting expenses\" directly implies an HR or finance-related system. While there's a technical element with the error, the core problem is related to the submission process itself. It's likely within a system managed by HR, making \"HR Support\" the best fit. I've now determined that the appropriate category is \"HR Support,\" as the user is encountering problems submitting expenses.\n\n\n\n"
