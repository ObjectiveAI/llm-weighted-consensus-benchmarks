The text seems a bit vague, but I'm leaning towards \"Access\" or possibly \"Administrative rights,\" because of the words \"reassign\" and \"assigned.\" I need to consider all the possibilities before making a definitive call. I'm focusing on the keywords and the context to make sure the category is correct.\n\n\n**Categorizing HR Ticket**\n\nI've closely analyzed the IT ticket text, focusing on keywords like \"reassignment\" and \"annual leave requests\". While \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" initially seemed possible, the emphasis on leave-related processes strongly points to \"HR Support.\" The context suggests a need to reassign duties during an employee's absence, which aligns perfectly with HR workflows. Therefore, I'm confident \"HR Support\" is the most accurate categorization.\n\n\n"
