After analyzing the text, my initial thought is leaning towards \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" given the mentions of notifications, approvals, and managers. I'm carefully considering the context to make a definitive classification. The key is to see if it is just a notification, or the access to an approver notification.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Issue**\n\nI've been re-evaluating the ticket's classification. Initially, I leaned towards \"Access\" but now I am focusing on keywords like \"time sheets,\" \"approver,\" and \"manager.\" These terms strongly suggest an HR-related workflow, prompting me to assign the ticket to \"HR Support\". The other categories seem less relevant given the context, so I am confident with the classification.\n\n\n**Analyzing the Ticket Content**\n\nI am now convinced this ticket is about HR Support. The terms \"time sheets,\" \"approver,\" and \"manager\" stand out as key indicators. I initially considered \"Access\" but the focus on workflow and approvals within the time sheet process strongly points to an HR-related issue. The notification aspect further supports this classification, as it relates to the process of approving those sheets.\n\n\n"
