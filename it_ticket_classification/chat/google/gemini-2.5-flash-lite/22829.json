I'm trying to determine the best category for this based on these clues. Right now, I'm leaning toward \"Internal Project\" as it seems to relate to pipeline development. I'm also considering if it could possibly be a \"Storage\" issue.\n\n\n**Revising Category Assignment**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket's keywords, particularly \"new pipeline\" and \"pipeline importance high\", and I'm solidifying my initial assessment. Categorizing this as an \"Internal Project\" is still the most fitting choice, as it aligns with the nature of pipeline development for monitoring purposes. The other categories don't seem like they'd fit. I've ruled out \"Miscellaneous\" as \"Internal Project\" is more specific to the context. I'm now certain on this.\n\n\n"
