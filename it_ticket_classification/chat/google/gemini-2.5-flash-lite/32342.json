My initial impression is that the recurring \"maternity leave\" theme is key. It seems related to either HR or some internal project, possibly around access rights changes.  I'm now cross-referencing these themes against the given categories to narrow down the best fit. I'm leaning towards \"HR Support\" or \"Internal Project,\" given the sensitive nature of the topic.\n\n\n**Focusing on Ticket Text**\n\nI've been intensively analyzing the IT ticket text. \"Maternity leave\" consistently pops up, which directly relates to the \"HR Support\" category. Although there are hints of access adjustments and administrative tasks, the overarching theme is clearly HR-related. The provided phrases support a strong connection to employee absence and related procedures, confirming my initial leaning. I've ruled out the other categories as the core functionality is centered on HR.\n\n\n**Refining Category Selection**\n\nMy focus is narrowing in on the best category for this ticket. While \"Access\" and \"Administrative Rights\" are possible, the core is undeniably \"maternity leave,\" a clear HR function. The text points to an absence-related process, including administrative duties, responsibility transfer, and resource management during the leave. Given the categories, \"HR Support\" aligns best, encapsulating the overall function of managing an employee's maternity leave, including related administrative tasks. I am eliminating other options as the primary driver here is HR-related.\n\n\n"
