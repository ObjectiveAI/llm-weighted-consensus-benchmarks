The \"restrict access,\" \"department only,\" and \"former\" keywords are all pointing me toward access control issues. Given the limited options, I think \"Access\" seems like the most relevant category.\n\n\n**Finalizing the Classification**\n\nI've solidified my categorization for this IT ticket. The preponderance of keywords related to access restriction and user permissions left no doubt.  I concluded that \"Access\" is the only suitable category, given the provided options. The repeated mentions of restricting, removing, and contributing access clinched it.\n\n\n"
