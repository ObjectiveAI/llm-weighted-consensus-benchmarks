My focus is on matching the keywords and the request's core purpose. \"New Confluence space\" and \"create Confluence\" suggest a software access or internal project angle, but I'm still trying to pick one. The phrase \"gather information relating source\" introduces a potentially separate facet to the request.\n\n\n**Categorizing the IT Request**\n\nI've been honing in on the \"Internal Project\" category. The keywords strongly point towards the need for a collaborative workspace, specifically to \"gather information relating source software.\" The user wants a \"new Confluence space,\" which, in essence, is a tool for a project, not hardware, HR, access, storage, purchase, or admin rights. While \"Miscellaneous\" is a potential fallback, \"Internal Project\" is more on point. I'm satisfied.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Best Fit**\n\nI've been re-evaluating the \"Internal Project\" category for this ticket. The phrases \"new confluence space\" and \"gather information\" strongly indicate a project workspace requirement. While \"Access\" could be a secondary aspect, the primary demand is for the workspace itself. I've ruled out all other categories - hardware, HR, storage, purchase, and admin rights - as they're not relevant. \"Miscellaneous\" is a backup, but \"Internal Project\" seems far more precise given the context.\n\n\n"
