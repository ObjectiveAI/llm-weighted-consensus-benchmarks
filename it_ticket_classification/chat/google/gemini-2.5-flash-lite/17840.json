The phrase \"leaver extension\" suggests it likely pertains to user access management, possibly related to an employee's departure. I'm leaning towards \"Access\" as the most fitting category from the provided options.\n\n**Categorizing User Request**\n\nI'm processing the ticket description, noting the recurring \"leaver\" theme. This strongly indicates actions related to user account management and access for departing employees. Therefore, I am proceeding with \"Access\" as the primary category.\n\n**Confirming HR Focus**\n\nI've thoroughly reviewed the ticket's detailed description. The overwhelming evidence points towards an employee offboarding process, commonly managed under HR support functions. While access revocation is a component, the comprehensive nature of the request, covering mailboxes, profiles, rights, and physical assets, solidifies \"HR Support\" as the most accurate overarching category.\n\n**Classifying Employee Departure**\n\nI've thoroughly analyzed the ticket's content. The overwhelming focus on \"leaver\" specific actions, encompassing account management, mailbox handling, profile updates, and asset retrieval, strongly aligns with the processes involved in employee offboarding. Therefore, I'm definitively categorizing this ticket under \"HR Support\" due to its comprehensive scope related to departing personnel.\n\n**Finalizing HR Classification**\n\nI've thoroughly reviewed all the details concerning the \"leaver\" and associated tasks. The comprehensive nature of managing account deactivations, data, and assets for departing personnel firmly establishes \"HR Support\" as the definitive and most appropriate category for this ticket.\n\n"
