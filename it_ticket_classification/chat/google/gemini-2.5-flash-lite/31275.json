Currently, I'm leaning towards a preliminary list of possible categories to narrow it down further. I plan to refine this list based on the presence of key terms and phrases within the provided text. My focus is on arriving at the most accurate single category for the JSON output.\n\n\n**Narrowing Category Scope**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on \"HR Support\" as the most likely category. The ticket text's frequent mentions of \"new starter\" and \"starter form internship\" strongly suggest an onboarding process. I'm excluding \"Hardware\" as the text doesn't indicate physical equipment issues. My immediate next step is to finalize the JSON output with \"category\": \"HR Support\" to confirm.\n\n\n**Determining Final Category**\n\nI've decided to refine the category to \"HR Support\". The text consistently mentions \"starter form internship\", \"new starter\", and onboarding tasks. I excluded \"Access\" because the focus isn't on a specific access request, but the general onboarding process. While \"Administrative rights\" might be tangentially involved, \"HR Support\" captures the core of the issue: initiating and processing new employee onboarding. The JSON output will be updated accordingly.\n\n\n"
