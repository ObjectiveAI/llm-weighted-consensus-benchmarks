After analyzing the ticket content, which mentions \"time card error\" and \"delete card,\" I've narrowed it down to a few potential categories. The most fitting options seem to be \"HR Support\" or \"Access\". I'm leaning towards \"Access\" due to the request to delete a card. I'll proceed with further analysis to be certain.\n\n\n**Confirming the Classification**\n\nI've examined the ticket content more closely, focusing on keywords like \"time card error\" and \"delete card.\" My initial thought was \"Access,\" but upon further reflection and considering the provided categories, \"HR Support\" appears to be the most accurate. The context of time card issues strongly suggests an HR-related matter, not an access issue. The request to \"delete card\" relates to a time tracking system, which HR typically manages.\n\n\n"
