I'm leaning towards categorizing this as either \"Access\" or \"HR Support\", but I need more context to be sure. My current focus is to determine the primary function, given this limited information.\n\n\n**Defining the Core Issue**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the best category. While \"Access\" and \"HR Support\" both fit, the \"new starter\" theme and \"starter form\" point more strongly toward a broader HR Support need. The \"credentials\" and \"created ad\" are vital but ancillary components. The equipment mentions are secondary to the larger function of onboarding, in my current opinion. I think it makes sense to choose HR support and access as primary and secondary categorizations of the ticket.\n\n\n**Pinpointing Primary Function**\n\nNow, I'm analyzing the ticket text more deeply, focusing on the key actions. While \"access\" is involved, the primary focus seems to be onboarding the \"new starter\". The keywords \"starter form\" and \"joining\" point strongly to HR support. I'm leaning toward selecting \"HR Support\" as the main ticket category, with \"Access\" as a sub-category.\n\n\n"
