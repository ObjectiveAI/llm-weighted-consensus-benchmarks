I'm leaning towards \"HR Support\" as the most fitting classification.\n\n**Classifying Ticket Data**\n\nI'm processing the IT ticket information, focusing on classifying its content. The mention of \"expense reports\" strongly suggests a connection to HR functions or financial systems. I've determined that \"HR Support\" is the most accurate category for this particular request.\n\n**Selecting Ticket Category**\n\nI've finalized my categorization of the IT ticket. Given the explicit mention of \"expense reports\" and the user's query on how to view older ones, I've concluded that \"HR Support\" is the most accurate classification, as this topic falls within typical HR or finance functions.\n\n**Determining Ticket Classification**\n\nI've analyzed the IT ticket content, which specifically mentions viewing \"expense reports older than months\" and personalizing search options. My current thought process is focused on selecting the most appropriate category from the provided enum. Based on the subject matter, \"HR Support\" appears to be the most fitting classification.\n\n"
