It seems to be related to both hardware, given the TV request, and perhaps IT Support or Operations given it relates to displaying performance stats for a team. The mention of budget and purchase further supports the hardware aspect. I'm leaning toward \"Hardware\" as the primary category for this ticket.\n\n\n**Analyzing the Details**\n\nI've been drilling down into the specific details of this IT ticket. After a careful review, the core request clearly centers on acquiring and installing a TV for displaying performance stats. The need for a physical monitor is the most prominent element, and the mention of budget and purchase further reinforces the hardware aspect. I'm now leaning more firmly toward \"Hardware\" as the most suitable primary category, although the operational need will need to be followed up on.\n\n\n**Confirming the Primary Category**\n\nI've finalized my assessment, concluding that \"Hardware\" is the most appropriate primary category for this IT ticket. The request's central focus revolves around the acquisition and deployment of a TV, making it a hardware-centric issue. While \"Purchase\" is relevant, it's a secondary aspect. \"Miscellaneous\" could also be considered, but \"Hardware\" provides the most precise and direct classification based on the ticket's core requirement.\n\n\n"
