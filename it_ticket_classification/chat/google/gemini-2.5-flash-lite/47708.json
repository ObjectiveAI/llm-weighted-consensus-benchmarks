I've narrowed down the categories, and I'm leaning heavily towards \"HR Support\" for this one, given the mention of annual leave and logging time. I'm double-checking to ensure there's no subtle nuance that would shift it, but that's my strong initial read.\n\n\n**Finalizing Ticket Assignment**\n\nI've reviewed the IT ticket's content again. Despite the technical nature of \"logging time,\" the recurring theme of \"annual leave\" confirms my initial instinct. My final decision is \"HR Support,\" as the user seems to be encountering issues with the annual leave logging process. I'm satisfied that this is the best fit, given the available choices.\n\n\n"
