The explicit mentions of \"new starter,\" \"mobile phone ordering,\" and associated costs strongly point towards a specific area. I am weighing whether \"Purchase\" or a broader \"HR Support\" encompassing onboarding is more fitting.\n\n**Assigning New Starter Request**\n\nI've identified the primary theme as new starter onboarding, with a specific focus on mobile phone procurement. Given the explicit mentions of \"new starter,\" \"re starter form complete,\" and the associated purchase order details, I'm leaning towards \"HR Support\" as the most fitting category to encompass the entire onboarding process.\n\n**Processing New Starter Request**\n\nI'm currently evaluating the ticket's core purpose. The repeated emphasis on \"new starter,\" the completion of a \"re starter form,\" and the explicit need to \"order a mobile phone\" all point towards an onboarding process. I'm deciding between \"HR Support\" and \"Purchase\" to best represent this initial setup requirement.\n\n**Categorizing Onboarding Request**\n\nI'm analyzing a new starter's IT ticket, focusing on terms like \"new starter\" and \"re starter form complete.\" My primary goal is to assign the most suitable category, weighing options like \"HR Support\" against \"Purchase\" given the explicit mention of ordering a mobile phone.\n\n**Identifying Core Request**\n\nI'm focusing on the explicit mention of \"new starter\" and the recurring phrase \"re starter form complete.\" My current analysis suggests that the primary driver of this ticket is the onboarding process for a new employee, with the mobile phone request being a specific component of that setup.\n\n**Classifying Onboarding Ticket**\n\nI've refined my categorization by focusing on the recurring \"new starter\" and \"re starter form complete\" mentions. The request for a mobile phone, along with associated purchase order details, firmly establishes this as part of the employee onboarding process. I'm classifying this under \"HR Support.\"\n\n"
