Given the absence of a direct \"Security\" option, I'm leaning towards \"Miscellaneous\" as the most fitting fallback, though I'm still considering if any other category might offer a slightly better contextual fit for this recurring security concern.\n\n**Choosing Ticket Category**\n\nI've analyzed the ticket content, recognizing the recurring theme of suspicious emails. Since no direct \"Security\" category exists, I've determined \"Miscellaneous\" to be the most appropriate classification for this issue.\n\n"
