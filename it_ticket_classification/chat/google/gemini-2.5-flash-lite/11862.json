Considering the keywords, \"new starter\" and \"July,\" I am leaning toward either \"HR Support\" or potentially \"Access\" if it pertains to onboarding. The phrasing suggests a new employee setup. I am eliminating other options, for now, because they aren't directly supported by this text.\n\n\n**Re-evaluating Category Choices**\n\nI'm reconsidering the initial categorization. While \"HR Support\" seemed promising, the lack of explicit HR-related keywords makes \"Access\" more fitting. The text focuses on the need for a \"new starter,\" which implies access provisioning. \"HR Support\" feels slightly broad without direct HR cues. I'm prioritizing \"Access\" now and reassessing other options.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Category: HR**\n\nI'm solidifying my choice of \"HR Support\" as the most relevant category. My current thinking revolves around the broad nature of the provided text. Considering \"new starter\" as the core theme, I believe it encompasses the broader onboarding process that the IT department is supporting. It is very likely that HR has submitted this request. I'm satisfied this category best captures the ticket's intent, and the implied HR involvement makes this choice much clearer.\n\n\n"
