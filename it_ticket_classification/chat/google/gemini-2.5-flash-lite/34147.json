I need to figure out which IT category this most aligns with: \"Hardware|HR Support|Access|Miscellaneous|Storage|Purchase|Internal Project|Administrative rights\".\n\n\n**Clarifying the Focus**\n\nOkay, the new focus is on refining the category. While \"Access\" seems promising, I'm now leaning more towards a combination of **Access and Storage**, given the emphasis on link sharing and folder access. I'm carefully considering whether the issue stems from an access *granting* problem or from the underlying storage mechanism and how the links are set up. Could it be a permissions issue within the shared folder itself, or a broader sharing setting problem? I am exploring the possibility of a \"Storage\" issue related to share permissions.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Access Problem**\n\nThe access issue is now clear: the user can't use links to access files, despite seemingly having permissions. Based on the ticket details, \"Access\" is the best fit from the provided categories. I am confident that the problem is directly related to access control and permissions, not storage limitations or other unrelated IT areas.\n\n\n"
