Identifying the main subject allows for direct mapping to the relevant IT category. My analysis involves parsing the text to find keywords or phrases that indicate the ticket's primary concern.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Issue**\n\nI'm zeroing in on the correct IT category. Based on the \"card\" theme and related action words like \"assign,\" \"replace,\" and \"activate,\" I've excluded \"Hardware\" as the primary issue and am leaning towards \"Access.\" This seems a perfect match given the context of card management.\n\n\n**Determining Ticket Topic**\n\nI've examined the ticket content for key phrases. \"Card,\" \"assign card,\" and \"activate card\" dominate, strongly aligning with access-related issues. Despite the various phrasings, the core theme is consistently around managing access credentials, specifically, access cards.\n\n\n"
