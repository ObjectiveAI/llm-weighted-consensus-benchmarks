The user reported lost messages yesterday, seeking restoration after a system error and multiple restarts failed to bring them back. My current task is to assign it to the most fitting category from the provided schema.\n\n**Selecting Appropriate Category**\n\nI've analyzed the provided IT ticket. The user's core issue revolves around unexpectedly lost messages and their desire to recover them, stemming from a system error and unsuccessful restarts. Given the available categories, I'm currently leaning towards \"Miscellaneous\" as the most fitting classification for this scenario.\n\n"
