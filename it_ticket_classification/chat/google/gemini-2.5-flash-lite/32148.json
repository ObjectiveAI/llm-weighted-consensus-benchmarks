This falls under the \"Access\" category, as it directly relates to user permissions and system entry.\n\n**Re-evaluating Category**\n\nI've refined my thinking on the ticket's classification. While initial thoughts leaned towards \"Access,\" a deeper dive into \"creating roles for Colombia staff,\" \"assigning queues,\" and \"employee starter forms\" points more strongly to \"HR Support\" as the overarching and most accurate category for this request.\n\n**Confirming HR Focus**\n\nI've solidified my classification. The ticket's emphasis on creating employee roles, managing staff in Colombia, and processing starter forms strongly aligns it with \"HR Support,\" superseding initial considerations of \"Access.\"\n\n"
