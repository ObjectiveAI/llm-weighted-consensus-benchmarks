This leads me to believe the ticket falls under HR Support.\n\n**Classifying Ticket Details**\n\nI've processed the latest information, analyzing keywords like \"timecards,\" \"leave,\" and \"submission processes.\" My current assessment strongly points towards the \"HR Support\" category for this IT ticket.\n\n"
