The core of the request revolves around tasks for employees who have departed, suggesting a strong link to HR administrative processes rather than hardware or direct access provisioning.\n\n**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm currently refining my understanding of the ticket's core request. The emphasis on submissions for departing employees and manager involvement strongly suggests an \"HR Support\" classification, rather than an \"Access\" issue.\n\n"
