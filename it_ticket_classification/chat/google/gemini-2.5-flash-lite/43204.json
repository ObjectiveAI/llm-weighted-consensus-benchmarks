The phrase \"issue with connection\" strongly suggests a network-related problem, though a dedicated network category isn't available. I'm leaning towards \"Miscellaneous\" as the best fit, given the provided options.\n\n**Classifying Connection Problem**\n\nI'm continuing to refine my categorization of the ticket. The phrase \"issue with connection\" is central. Given the available options and the common causes of connection problems, I'm now leaning towards classifying this under \"Hardware\" as it could relate to network interface issues, rather than the broader \"Miscellaneous.\"\n\n**Selecting Ticket Category**\n\nI've been analyzing the ticket text to assign it the most suitable category. The core issue revolves around a \"connection.\" Given the provided options of Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights, I'm currently weighing \"Hardware\" against \"Miscellaneous.\" My reasoning is that connection problems often stem from network-related hardware.\n\n**Categorizing Connectivity**\n\nI'm analyzing the ticket text to assign the most appropriate category.
