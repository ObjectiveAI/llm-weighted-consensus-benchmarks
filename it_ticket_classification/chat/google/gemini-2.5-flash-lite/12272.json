                    "reasoning": "**Determining Category Now**\n\nI'm currently focused on the challenge of accurately assigning this ticket to the right IT category. The text provided is short, which is a bit of a challenge. I am trying to understand whether the phrase \"roles configuration\" leans towards \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" as that is where I am leaning now. There is also the potential of \"Internal Project,\" depending on context.\n\n\n**Evaluating Role Assignment**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and the potential categories. The user's query about \"roles configuration\" and associated \"rights\" leans towards either Access or Administrative rights, although \"Internal Project\" is a possibility. The phrase \"troubles connecting\" supports Access, but the core focus feels more like *configuring* permissions. The mention of \"product owner\" and \"obtain materials\" makes Internal Project a contender. I'm leaning toward Access/Administrative Rights, but need further clarification to be certain.\n\n\n**Focusing On Administrative Roles**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on \"Administrative rights\" as the most likely category. The constant mention of \"roles configuration\" and \"rights\" is key. While \"Internal Project\" is still a possibility, the text's emphasis is on configuring permissions, not necessarily on a project's broader setup. I'm prioritizing the core function of setting up access levels and entitlements, which is firmly within the scope of administrative rights management.\n\n\n**Finalizing the Classification**\n\nI've carefully considered the given text and various potential categories, and believe I've zeroed in on the most accurate classification. I have ruled out most categories, focusing on \"Access,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" The repetitive use of \"roles configuration\" and the phrase \"rights roles\" has guided me to consider administrative rights as the most precise description, as it encompasses the defining, assigning, and managing of the access rights and permissions connected to specific roles. The phrase \"troubles connecting\" and \"obtain materials\" don't outweigh the significance of these central phrases. Therefore, I am settling with \"Administrative rights.\"\n\n\n"
