Initially, I thought \"HR Support\" due to the mention of a \"people manager change\". However, after re-reading the text, I'm considering \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" because \"approving\" and \"assigning\" strongly suggest permission adjustments. I'm leaning more towards \"Administrative rights\" but will need to review other options.\n\n\n**Pinpointing The Best Fit**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the text and the available categories. While \"HR Support\" seemed initially promising due to \"people manager change,\" I've since ruled it out as the best fit. I'm now leaning away from \"Access\" and \"Administrative Rights\" due to lack of direct relevance to either.  The focus will now be on exploring the other options. I'm focusing on trying to determine what kind of approvals or assignments are being requested to pinpoint the best category.\n\n\n**Determining the Core Issue**\n\nI've been drilling down on this ticket, re-examining each phrase. \"People manager change\" definitely points towards HR, and the February date solidifies it further. \"Approve\" and \"assigning\" are more general action verbs, not necessarily tied to access or admin rights. While \"developer\" provides context, it doesn't shift the focus away from the core HR-related issue.  Therefore, \"HR Support\" is becoming even clearer.\n\n\n"
