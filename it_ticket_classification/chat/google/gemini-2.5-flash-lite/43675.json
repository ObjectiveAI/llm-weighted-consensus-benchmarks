I am carefully weighing this against the other categories to confirm my initial hypothesis.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Core Issue**\n\nI've just refined my reasoning and concluded \"Access\" is the most fitting category. The repeated mentions of \"keys,\" \"machines,\" and the process of \"connecting\" definitively point towards an access-related problem. I've ruled out other categories as they are not as relevant.\n\n\n"
