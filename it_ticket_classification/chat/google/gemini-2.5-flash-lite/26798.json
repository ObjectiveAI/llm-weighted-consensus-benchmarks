It seems the provided text doesn't explicitly mention any hardware issues, human resources requests, access problems, storage, purchases, or internal projects. However, \"new starter\" and \"re starter form\" could be related to either HR or Access, but lack sufficient detail. I'm leaning toward \"Miscellaneous\" due to the vagueness.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Onboarding**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and the potential categories. The \"new starter\" and \"re starter form\" text strongly points to an HR-related onboarding process. While access rights are often granted during onboarding, the core of the request is the \"starter form,\" suggesting a deeper connection to HR functions, thus making HR Support the most relevant category.\n\n\n**Assessing Ticket Details**\n\nI'm now revisiting the text in the IT ticket, aiming to refine the category selection. Examining \"new starter\" and \"starter form,\" the HR-centric nature is further solidified. While access might be a component, the primary concern revolves around the form itself, making HR Support the most relevant. The dates provided are context clues, but they don't change the onboarding's core HR emphasis.\n\n\n"
