The text indicates \"new interns\" and \"accounts created\", alongside the term \"bulk\". Initially, I'm leaning toward \"Access\" because of the account creation component, but I'm also considering the possibility of \"HR Support\" due to the intern-related context. The \"bulk\" aspect adds a layer of complexity; I am now evaluating the possibility of the \"Administrative rights\" category.\n\n\n**Finalizing Ticket Assignment**\n\nI've significantly refined my analysis. While initially torn between \"Access\" and \"HR Support,\" the repeated emphasis on \"accounts created\" and \"prepare needed accounts\" firmly pushes me toward \"Access.\" The \"new interns\" context complicates it, but I see that IT is *implementing* HRs decision, in other words, IT is responsible for the Access requests. So the IT category is now set.\n\n\n**Clarifying the Core Category**\n\nI've been meticulously comparing \"HR Support\" and \"Access\". The core focus remains on supporting HR's onboarding workflow and the keywords like \"interns\" and \"starter form\". I am leaning toward \"HR Support\" because this encompasses the initiation of this process. The creation of \"accounts\" can be seen as the IT *support* to HR's request.\n\n\n"
