I've ruled out Hardware, Storage, Purchase, and Internal Project. Access and Administrative Rights don't seem like the best fits either. HR Support and Miscellaneous are the remaining contenders, and I'm leaning toward HR Support given the nature of the issue.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Issue**\n\nI've honed in on the HR Support option. While initially considering Miscellaneous, the core timecard submission issue points strongly toward HR's domain. The user is facing problems relating to the submission and approval of timecards. I've ruled out the other options because they are not a good fit. I'm confident HR Support is the best category.\n\n\n"
