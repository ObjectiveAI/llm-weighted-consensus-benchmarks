The text mentions \"logging time cards,\" \"Oracle,\" and \"maternity leave.\" Initially, \"HR Support\" seems relevant due to the maternity leave aspect, but \"Access\" might also be applicable depending on the nature of the \"Oracle\" component related to time cards. I'm leaning toward \"HR Support\" as the primary category and \"Access\" as a potential secondary one, though I need to carefully weigh the time card function as a whole.\n\n\n**Analyzing HR System Functionality**\n\nI've been evaluating the suitability of \"HR Support\" for the ticket, given its focus on time card logging, maternity leave, and delegation rules.  The problems appear to be within HR processes and applications, despite the \"Oracle\" mention, leading me to lean strongly toward \"HR Support\" as the primary category. The \"profile cards\" issue also fits here.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've been drilling down on the essential problem in this ticket, and the \"profile cards\" issue has grabbed my attention. The fact that managers aren't receiving them strongly indicates a malfunction within the HR system or its associated processes. This is likely due to the delegation rule or time-card related configuration. It points directly to \"HR Support\" as the most relevant category.\n\n\n"
