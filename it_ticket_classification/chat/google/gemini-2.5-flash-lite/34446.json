After analyzing the text, I'm leaning toward \"Access\" as the most suitable category. The issue is focused on a recurring problem with an \"idea license,\" which I believe falls under access-related issues. I'm double-checking to confirm that this choice aligns best with the provided options.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've refined my initial classification. While \"Access\" still seems most suitable, I'm now certain about it. The recurring \"idea license\" issue, particularly during leave, directly impacts the user's ability to access the software. I considered other options, but \"Access\" precisely reflects the core problem, ensuring the user can utilize the software. I feel confident.\n\n\n"
