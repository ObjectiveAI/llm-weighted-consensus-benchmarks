I'm cross-referencing this with other potential keywords and phrases to ensure accuracy before making a final classification.\n\n\n**Defining Ticket Classification**\n\nThe ticket's consistent use of access-related terms like \"cannot access resources\" and \"accessing\" confirms my initial assessment. I've ruled out other categories like Hardware and Storage, as their criteria don't align. The evidence overwhelmingly supports classifying the ticket under \"Access.\"\n\n\n"
