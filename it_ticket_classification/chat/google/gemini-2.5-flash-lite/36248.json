The phrases \"connection not working,\" \"can connect through cable only,\" and \"was working Friday\" are key. I'm leaning toward either \"Hardware\" or \"Access\" as the most appropriate categories based on this preliminary understanding. I'm now cross-referencing this with the provided list.\n\n\n**Revising Category Choice**\n\nAfter reviewing the ticket again and considering all possible categories, I've narrowed it down.  While \"Hardware\" felt right initially, a closer look reveals the core issue is network connectivity. It might not be a physical hardware failure, but rather a configuration problem. The issue is likely access-related. \"Access\" now seems more accurate, suggesting that the problem involves how the user *accesses* the network, be it wireless, or through a particular port.\n\n\n**Confirming Hardware Diagnosis**\n\nAfter careful consideration of the ticket text and the available categories, I'm confident that \"Hardware\" best encapsulates the root of the problem. While network *access* is disrupted, the text specifically mentions cable connectivity, suggesting a potential hardware fault.  The cable working implies it's not a general network outage. Thus, a faulty network port, adapter, or cable is the likely culprit.\n\n\n"
