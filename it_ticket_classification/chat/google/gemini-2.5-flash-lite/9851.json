I've noticed mentions of a \"leaver form,\" \"re leaver form,\" and \"line manager,\" which suggests a possible HR Support issue. I'm carefully analyzing the context to ensure the best category is chosen, given the limited information in the ticket text.\n\n\n**Analyzing HR Context**\n\nI've further analyzed the ticket's text, focusing on keywords and phrases. I've ruled out \"Hardware,\" \"Storage,\" and other irrelevant options. Based on the \"leaver form\" mentions, I'm confident \"HR Support\" is the primary category. While \"Access\" is indirectly connected, the ticket centers on the HR process itself, aligning strongly with the HR Support category. The goal is to accurately direct the ticket for efficient resolution.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Category Accuracy**\n\nI've determined that the \"HR Support\" category is the best fit. While \"Access\" could be related, the primary focus seems to be on the \"leaver form\" process. Analyzing the ticket text,  I feel confident that this ticket revolves around HR procedures. Keywords like \"received leaver\" and \"submit leaver form\" strengthen this classification. I'm prioritizing accuracy to streamline the workflow.\n\n\n"
