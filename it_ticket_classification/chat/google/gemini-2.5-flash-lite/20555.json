The text indicates a focus on cost reports and modifying fields within them, with an emphasis on approval and investigation processes. My current assessment places it between \"Purchase\" and \"Internal Project\", but I need to ensure a better fit.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Scope**\n\nI am now focusing on refining the category. The recurring theme is modification to an existing report, involving approval and investigation processes, which suggests some development work or project-related activity. Considering it's a request from a senior engineer, \"Internal Project\" still seems a good fit, but I'm keeping \"Miscellaneous\" in mind as a backup.\n\n\n**Pinpointing Ticket Classification**\n\nCurrently, I'm solidifying the \"Internal Project\" category. The key elements point towards development or modification of an internal tool. The engineer's request to add fields, coupled with the need for approval and investigation, aligns closely with project-related activities. Although \"Miscellaneous\" could be an option, \"Internal Project\" better encapsulates the nature of this request.\n\n\n"
