I am now considering the appropriate category.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've refined my focus to \"Access,\" as the ticket details a discrepancy in visitor card control and involves collaboration with a likely access management system (\"OMS\"). The \"internal audit\" aspect supports this categorization. The spreadsheet and recording tasks are secondary to the primary issue of access control validation. I'm satisfied this captures the essence of the ticket.\n\n\n**Determining Ticket Essence**\n\nI'm now fully immersed in the nuances of this ticket. The initial categorization of \"Access\" feels even more solid after a closer examination. The phrase \"visitor cards\" coupled with \"discrepancy\" and the need for \"correction\" makes \"Access\" the indisputable best fit, especially considering it demands collaboration with an \"OMS\" system or department. My confidence in this categorization is at its peak.\n\n\n"
