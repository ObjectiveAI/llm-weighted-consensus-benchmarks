My immediate goal is to accurately categorize each ticket by mapping its text to one of the predefined categories like \"Hardware,\" \"Access,\" or \"HR Support.\" I'm working through the provided text to establish this mapping.\n\n**Mapping Ticket Content**\n\nI've analyzed the ticket's text, and the recurring themes of \"access,\" \"permissions,\" and \"accounts\" for sites and resources clearly point towards the \"Access\" category. No other categories seem to fit.\n\n**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI've analyzed the ticket's content, and the consistent references to \"access,\" \"permissions,\" and \"accounts\" for various sites and resources strongly indicate the \"Access\" category. Other possibilities like \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights\" don't capture the core request as effectively.\n\n"
