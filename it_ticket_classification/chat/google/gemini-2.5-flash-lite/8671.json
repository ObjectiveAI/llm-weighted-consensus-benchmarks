Considering the keywords like \"access card,\" \"replacement,\" and \"deactivate,\" it's becoming clear that \"Access\" is the most fitting classification. I'm focusing on the core issue of access control and identifying which subcategory, such as new card or deactivation, will also need to be determined.\n\n\n**Narrowing the Focus**\n\nIt looks like \"Access\" is still the most appropriate overarching category. I've eliminated some options: \"Hardware\" seems a bit too broad when the ticket's really about managing access itself. I'm now debating the best subcategory given the terms in the ticket. It's leaning towards something related to lost cards and new replacements.\n\n\n"
