My initial focus has shifted toward building a robust mapping process. The goal is to accurately translate any ticket description into one of eight distinct categories. I'm exploring different approaches to ensure consistent and precise assignments, considering the nuances of language used in typical IT support requests.\n\n\n**Analyzing Access Problems**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the latest input, focusing on the recurrent theme of access and connectivity. The \"cannot connect\" and expired certificate issues are steering me toward \"Access\" or potentially \"Administrative rights\".  I'm now refining the decision-making process to differentiate these subtle categories based on the specific symptoms described in the tickets.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Access Issues**\n\nI've been analyzing the latest input, I'm now honing in on Access. The expired certificate in these tickets is a clear indicator, and I'm updating the logic to weigh access-related keywords more heavily. I'm focusing on \"cannot connect\" and \"expired certificate\", ensuring these consistently map to \"Access\". The goal is to accurately identify and prioritize access problems.\n\n\n"
