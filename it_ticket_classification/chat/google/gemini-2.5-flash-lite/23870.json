Initially, I thought \"Access\" seemed most appropriate due to the keywords \"access card\" and \"access\". However, the context of a \"maternity leaver form\" has me leaning toward a potential crossover with HR support, and a secondary consideration, as access is intrinsically involved. I'm exploring the implications of both and what factors may make one more dominant than the other.\n\n\n**Finalizing the Classification**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's nature, focusing on the keywords and context. The \"maternity leaver form\" points strongly towards HR processes. While access is a component, it's a consequence of the HR event, not the primary cause. I now lean toward the \"HR Support\" category as the most accurate classification, reflecting the root issue more precisely. I believe this categorization is the best fit.\n\n\n**Confirming the Primary Category**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket, focusing on the core driver, which is the \"maternity leaver form.\" This clearly aligns with an HR process, despite the inherent connection to access card management. The form's purpose is to manage an employee's status related to HR, not just to change access. While access is a component, the origin and primary focus lie within HR. Therefore, I believe \"HR Support\" best reflects the ticket's primary nature.\n\n\n"
