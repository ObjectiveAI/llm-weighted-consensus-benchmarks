The ticket text strongly suggests a need to revoke or modify server access, especially with mentions of \"removed,\" \"rights,\" and \"main location.\" While \"human resources\" appears, it seems incidental to the core access issue. This text is leading me to believe this is an access issue related to an employee no longer needing access to the server.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Focus**\n\nI've been honing in on the \"Access\" category. While the mention of \"human resources\" initially caused some pause, I now see it as secondary to the core request: removal of server access. The phrase \"server access to be removed\" is the most telling phrase. I am confident \"Access\" is the most appropriate categorization.\n\n\n**Analyzing Ticket Content**\n\nI'm now certain about the core category. The repeated emphasis on \"server access to be removed\" outweighs the HR mention. It's a clear access request and the phrase trumps any HR connections. I am leaning toward Access, as the issue is about management and not support for the HR department. The references to \"locations\" and \"rights\" continue to reinforce this. The text is leaning on the word \"access\".\n\n\n"
