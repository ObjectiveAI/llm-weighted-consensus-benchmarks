The text indicates permission changes and restoration, specifically concerning \"visitors.\" My initial assessment leans towards \"Access,\" but I need to ensure it's not a hardware or administrative rights issue. I'll carefully consider the context of \"sector\" to finalize the categorization.\n\n\n**Pinpointing Access Issue**\n\nI've analyzed the ticket text focusing on \"permissions,\" \"access,\" and \"visitors\" uploading documents. The core problem is access control. I've considered potential categories, like \"Administrative rights,\" but \"Access\" is more directly relevant. The ticket isn't about hardware, HR, storage capacity, purchases, internal projects, or administrative rights, so Access seems most appropriate.\n\n\n"
