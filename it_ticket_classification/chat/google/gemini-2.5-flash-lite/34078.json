The initial text \"problem with contact contact\" is ambiguous, so I need to dig deeper. While \"communication\" or a similar category seems plausible, I'll need more context to make a definitive assignment. The phrase \"dear colleagues can\" needs more context to determine the proper category.\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nI've narrowed the ticket's core issue down to an application system problem, specifically hindering a job application. The text \"errors have prohibited submitting application\" is the key indicator. It's looking more like an HR support issue, given the context of application materials and the request for alternative submission. My focus remains on pinpointing the specific system causing the error to further refine the HR Support category.\n\n\n**Clarifying the Core Issue**\n\nI've determined the key problem is an application submission error, directly impacting a job applicant. The mention of \"errors have prohibited submitting application\" solidified my focus. While the category \"HR Support\" still seems most applicable, the context now suggests it's a specific system error. I will still focus on HR support.\n\n\n"
