The presence of terms like \"change manager\" strongly suggests an \"Access\" or \"Administrative Rights\" issue. My updated logic prioritizes these terms, and I'm further refining it by comparing the likelihood of the two categories. I am considering the weight that the presence of other terms might have in this decision.\n\n\n**Categorizing Access Issues**\n\nI have made progress. The \"change manager\" term continues to be a strong indicator of access-related issues. Now, I am refining the criteria to ensure the ticket is accurately categorized. The term is very indicative of \"Access\" or \"Administrative Rights\" issues. After reviewing the terms, my logic prioritizes these terms over the other categories.\n\n\n"
