Initial analysis is suggesting an issue related to time reporting, with mentions of missing data and closed reports. The keywords are pointing towards a possible HR Support issue, but I'm still weighing the other options.\n\n\n**Clarifying HR Implications**\n\nThe text analysis is yielding a clear HR focus. My assessment now centers on how the keywords point toward employee time tracking and reporting. Phrases like \"missing time,\" \"leavers,\" and \"update person record\" are pushing me toward HR Support. The core of this ticket seems to be around issues with adhering to time-reporting processes, which further solidifies my classification.\n\n\n"
