The text consistently points towards \"reports,\" specifically Oracle reports.  Based on the limited options, \"Access\" seems like the closest fit, as it directly relates to accessing specific information or systems. However, I want to confirm if a more relevant option exists before proceeding.\n\n\n**Clarifying Access Requirements**\n\nI've determined that \"Access\" appears to be the most fitting category. However, the mention of \"rights reports\" adds a slight wrinkle. While \"Access\" is still the primary need, there's a possibility of needing *administrative rights* as well. I'm focusing on clarifying if the user requires broader system control or simply access to specific reports. Determining this nuance is critical to the ticket's accurate classification.\n\n\n**Defining Access Scope**\n\nMy focus has shifted slightly. While \"Access\" is still the primary category, I'm now drilling down on the scope of that access. The user specifically requests \"access to Oracle reports.\" The term \"rights reports\" suggests they might need more than simple viewing. I'm exploring whether \"administrative rights\" could be implicit, but leaning towards \"Access\" for now. Clarifying the level of control over the reports is the next step.\n\n\n"
