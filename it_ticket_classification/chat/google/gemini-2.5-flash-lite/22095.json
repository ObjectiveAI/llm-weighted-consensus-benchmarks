I'm leaning toward the \"Access\" category, as these terms strongly suggest card access and related permissions. I'm evaluating if any other category, such as HR support, could be relevant, but the focus appears to be purely about access control.\n\n\n**Refining Category Selection**\n\nI've solidified my choice, focusing on the keywords. \"Leavers access,\" \"lost cards,\" and \"returned cards\" directly point towards access management. \"Re-issue cards\" further reinforces this. While other categories might touch on related issues, the core issue is clearly about physical and potentially digital access control. Hence, \"Access\" remains the most accurate categorization, given the text provided.\n\n\n"
