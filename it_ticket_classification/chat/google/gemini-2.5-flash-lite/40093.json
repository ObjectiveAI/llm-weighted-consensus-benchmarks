The poor call quality of meeting room phones feels strongly like a hardware issue. I'm focusing on \"Hardware\" as the primary candidate, while also considering if any other category, such as \"Miscellaneous\", might also apply. I'll need to carefully weigh the evidence to land on the correct classification.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Hardware Diagnostics**\n\nMy analysis strongly suggests a hardware issue is at play, stemming from the meeting room phones' poor call quality.  I'm firmly leaning toward categorizing this ticket under \"Hardware\". While the description doesn't explicitly mention other categories, I'm performing one last check to confirm nothing else applies before finalizing the categorization.\n\n\n"
