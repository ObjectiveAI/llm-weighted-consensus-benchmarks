The terms \"missing time\", \"wrong start date\", and \"oracle sent Wednesday\" are giving me clues, but I need to make a more confident decision. My current thought is leaning towards something related to the system's ability to track time accurately.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Scope**\n\nI've been drilling down on the ticket details, isolating core themes.  My analysis of \"missing time\", \"wrong start date,\" and submission dates solidifies my suspicion of a payroll or timekeeping issue. I'm focusing on \"HR\" as the most probable category now. The onboarding date also reinforced this.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Problem**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's language, focusing on keywords to narrow down the possible categories. I'm now leaning heavily towards an HR-related issue. The employee's start date issue and the time entry discrepancies strongly suggest a need for HR support. The processes described are clearly part of an HR function.\n\n\n"
