My process involves analyzing the ticket text and mapping it to the predefined categories. I'm carefully considering the wording of each ticket to ensure I assign it to the most relevant category.\n\n\n**Identifying Appropriate Category**\n\nThe ticket text, focusing on folder size and storage, clearly points toward the \"Storage\" category. Keywords like \"folder size limitations,\" \"requested storage,\" and \"uploads\" confirm this. Other categories such as \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and \"Purchase\" don't align with the ticket's core issue, which is clearly about storage capacity. Therefore, \"Storage\" is the most appropriate category for this ticket.\n\n\n**Defining Ticket Classification**\n\nCurrently, I'm working to classify the IT ticket based on keywords. The ticket's content, focusing on storage capacity, points definitively to the \"Storage\" category. Key phrases like \"folder size limitations,\" \"requested storage,\" and \"uploads\" are unambiguous indicators. I'm structuring the response as a JSON object with \"Storage\" as the specified category.\n\n\n"
