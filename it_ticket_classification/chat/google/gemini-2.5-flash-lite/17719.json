I'm building a system to use keywords to help assign the most relevant category.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down Criteria**\n\nI've refined my approach to categorize IT tickets, focusing on specific keywords. \"New folder,\" \"restricted access,\" and related phrases lead me to prioritize \"Access.\" The emphasis is on permissions and control, making \"Access\" a more precise fit than \"Storage,\" which is less relevant given the context.\n\n\n**Expanding Keyword Relevance**\n\nI've further analyzed the IT ticket text, focusing on the keywords \"folder permissions,\" \"create restricted folder,\" and \"permissions level.\" These strongly reinforce my initial assessment that \"Access\" is the most relevant category. My thinking has shifted to evaluating sub-categories within \"Access,\" but for now, \"Access\" remains the primary focus. I'm building a more robust system by examining related phrases and synonyms to improve categorization accuracy.\n\n\n"
