Keywords like \"quarantine,\" \"deleted automatically,\" and \"log\" strongly indicate a \"Storage\" issue related to email management and retention policies.\n\n**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm currently analyzing an IT ticket description. The keywords \"quarantine,\" \"deleted automatically,\" and \"log\" strongly suggest that the issue pertains to email management and retention policies, leaning towards a \"Storage\" categorization.\n\n**Analyzing Email Ticket Data**\n\nI'm currently analyzing an IT ticket focused on email issues. Keywords like \"quarantine,\" \"deleted automatically after days,\" and \"log\" indicate the problem likely relates to email retention policies and management of stored email data, making \"Storage\" the most appropriate category.\n\n**Processing Email Retrieval Needs**\n\nI'm focusing on classifying an IT ticket. The keywords \"quarantine\" and \"retrieve mail\" suggest an access-related issue, but the mention of \"deleted automatically after days\" points more strongly towards email storage and retention policies, making \"Storage\" the most appropriate category.\n\n**Refining Ticket Categorization**\n\nI'm continuing to analyze the IT ticket, and the keywords \"quarantine,\" \"deleted automatically after days,\" and \"log\" strongly indicate that the underlying issue relates to email storage management and retention policies, thus pointing towards the \"Storage\" category.\n\n**Categorizing Email Data**\n\nMy current focus is on assigning an IT ticket to the \"Storage\" category. The keywords \"quarantine,\" \"deleted automatically after days,\" and \"log\" strongly suggest the user's concern relates to email data management and retention policies.\n\n"
