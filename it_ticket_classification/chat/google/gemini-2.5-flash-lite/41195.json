The ticket's mention of \"timecards\" suggests \"HR Support\" as a primary candidate.\n\n**Classifying IT Requests**\n\nI'm continuing to refine my categorization of IT requests. Based on the details about \"timecards,\" \"annual leave,\" and \"working hours,\" I've confirmed \"HR Support\" is the most fitting classification, as it directly relates to human resources functions.\n\n"
