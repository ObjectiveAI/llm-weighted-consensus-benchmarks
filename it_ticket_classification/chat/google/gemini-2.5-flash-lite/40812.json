The user's having trouble connecting a client through a wireless cable, and wants help with setup. I've got to find the right category for this. Right now, I'm thinking about which one of the provided options best fits this technical support request.\n\n\n**Defining Ticket Category**\n\nI've been going through the ticket details and identified the core issue: the user is facing client connection problems via a wireless cable and needs setup assistance. Analyzing the categories, \"Hardware\" seems the best fit due to the focus on the physical connection and devices involved in network connectivity. Other options like \"Access\" are less relevant, as the issue is at the connection level, not resource access.\n\n\n"
