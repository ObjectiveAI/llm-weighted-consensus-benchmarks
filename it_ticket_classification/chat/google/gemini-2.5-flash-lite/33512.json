The words \"new starter,\" \"interns,\" and \"job offers\" strongly suggest an HR-related issue. This seems like a good fit, so I'm leaning toward selecting \"HR Support\" as the initial classification. I'll need to confirm that this is the best fit, as the text is a little vague.\n\n\n**Defining the Category**\n\nI've honed in on \"HR Support\" as the definitive category. My reasoning is solid: the ticket text highlights employee onboarding. Specifically, setting up accounts, credentials, and addressing new hires aligns perfectly with HR's responsibilities. It's much more aligned with \"HR Support\" than simply access control, project management, or other options. The process clearly indicates actions related to onboarding new employees. Therefore, I believe HR Support is correct.\n\n\n"
