The user's mention of filter saving and apparent ability to interact with the save button strongly points to a permissions-related problem rather than a general hardware or miscellaneous issue.\n\n**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm currently reviewing a ticket concerning a dashboard report and filter saving. My focus is on pinpointing the most accurate category from the available options, considering the nuances of the reported issue. I'm analyzing the phrasing \"seems have access save them\" and \"save button active\" to make the best selection.\n\n**Assigning Ticket Category**\n\nThe ticket about the dashboard report issue will be categorized as \"Access\". The description points strongly towards a permissions problem with saving filters, where the save button is active but the user experiences an issue with this functionality, aligning best with an access-related classification.\n\n**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm currently reviewing a ticket concerning a dashboard report and filter saving. My focus is on pinpointing the most accurate category from the available options, considering the nuances of the reported issue. I'm analyzing the phrasing \"seems have access save them\" and \"save button active\" to make the best selection.\n\n**Refining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm currently evaluating the best category for a dashboard report issue. The user's description suggests a problem with saving filters, where the save button is active but the action may be restricted, leading me to consider \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" as the most probable classifications.\n\n**Investigating Access Rights**\n\nI'm refining my assessment of the dashboard report ticket. The user's description, particularly \"seems have access save them\" with the \"save button active,\" strongly suggests a permissions issue. I'm leaning towards categorizing this under \"Access\" as it directly relates to the user's ability to perform the save function.\n\n**Refining Category Assignment**\n\nI'm currently focused on the dashboard report ticket. The user's report about filter saving, despite the save button being active, strongly suggests a permissions issue rather than a general functional bug, leading me to lean towards \"Access\" or potentially \"Administrative rights.\"\n\n**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm currently assessing a dashboard report issue where the user cannot save filters. Given the \"save button active\" but the saving action failing, I'm focusing on whether this falls under general \"Access\" or specifically \"Administrative rights\" due to the modification nature of saving.\n\n**Categorizing Dashboard Permissions**\n\nI'm currently refining my categorization for a dashboard report ticket. The user can see the save button for filters but reports an inability to save. This strongly points to a permissions issue, leading me to favor \"Administrative rights\" as the most accurate classification due to the modification action involved.\n\n**Assigning Dashboard Permissions**\n\nI'm finalizing my assessment of the dashboard report ticket. The user can interact with the save button for filters, but the saving functionality is failing, strongly indicating a permissions issue that aligns best with \"Administrative rights\" due to the modification action involved.\n\n**Categorizing Dashboard Permissions**\n\nI'm currently refining my categorization for a dashboard report ticket.

The user's inability to save filters, despite the save button being active, points strongly towards a permissions issue related to modification capabilities. This aligns best with \"Administrative rights\" as it signifies the need for elevated privileges to perform such actions.\n\n**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm currently assessing a dashboard report issue where the user cannot save filters.
