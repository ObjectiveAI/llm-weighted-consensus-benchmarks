Based on the text, initial thoughts lean towards \"HR Support\" due to references to a \"new starter\" and annual leave. However, the mention of \"filled officer\" makes me want to investigate if the ticket could relate to access or some other related IT matter. I need to be sure before I make my selection.\n\n\n**Revising Categorization Focus**\n\nI'm reconsidering the ticket's categorization. My initial thoughts centered on \"HR Support\" due to the new starter and leave mentions. However, I've dug deeper. The text's brevity and the term \"filled officer\" suggest a potential IT aspect, even if it's secondary. The onboarding might involve access provisioning. I'm leaning toward \"Access\" for now, pending further clarification, since the user *is* a new starter and may have access concerns.\n\n\n**Pinpointing HR Alignment**\n\nI've gone back and forth. The initial \"HR Support\" categorization seemed right, with its focus on \"new starter\" and \"annual leave.\" However, given the context, I now believe my initial analysis was correct. The \"filled officer\" and date fill-in request still lean towards an HR-driven process. While IT might be involved, the core action seems rooted in HR. I feel confident in sticking with \"HR Support.\"\n\n\n"
