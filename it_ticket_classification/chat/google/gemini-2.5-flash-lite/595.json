I've ruled out Hardware, Storage, Purchase, and Administrative rights, due to the nature of the request.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Access Category**\n\nI've narrowed the options down considerably. Based on the ticket text, \"access\" appears to be the most relevant category. The new starter's need for \"AD credentials\" strongly suggests access provisioning. While HR's involvement is likely, the core request is fundamentally IT-related. I will proceed with this classification.\n\n\n**Defining Appropriate Classification**\n\nNow, I've thoroughly reviewed the ticket text, considering each available category. I've eliminated Hardware, HR Support (though related), Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. My primary focus is on \"Access,\" as the \"AD credentials\" reference directly pertains to this category. The new starter process clearly falls under access provisioning. I'm satisfied that \"Access\" is the most specific and accurate.\n\n\n"
