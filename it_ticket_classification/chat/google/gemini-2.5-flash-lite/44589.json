I've ruled out the other categories like Hardware or HR. I'm focusing on defining the network issue to ensure the proper assignment.\n\n\n**Refining Category Assignment**\n\nI'm now revisiting the \"Hardware\" category. Although initially hesitant, the network speed problem strongly points to infrastructure issues. Slow cable speeds are a hardware-related issue, affecting network performance. I'm leaning toward assigning the ticket to \"Hardware\" for now, considering the available options. \"Miscellaneous\" remains an alternative, but \"Hardware\" seems more precise given the cable-specific problem.\n\n\n**Categorizing Network Issue**\n\nI'm now revisiting the \"Hardware\" category, and I'm leaning toward it as the best fit. I've re-evaluated the scope of \"Hardware\" to encompass network infrastructure components like cables. Slow \"network speeds\" and \"cable speeds\" point directly to hardware-related performance issues. Despite the lack of a \"Network\" category, the problem stems from the physical infrastructure, not just general performance or access.\n\n\n**Analyzing the Ticket Text**\n\nI'm now revisiting the \"Hardware\" category, and I'm leaning toward it as the best fit.
