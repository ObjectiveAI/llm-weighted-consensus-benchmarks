However, I'm considering if \"Hardware\" might also be applicable due to the monitor reference. I'll need to weigh these two categories carefully.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Ticket Context**\n\nI've carefully analyzed the ticket text: \"new purchase po tuesday purchase po dear purchased monitor please log installation kind regards administrator.\" \"Purchase\" seems to be the primary focus due to the repeated terms \"purchase\" and the context of ordering a monitor. Although \"monitor\" suggests \"Hardware,\" the act of buying the monitor, as indicated by the terms \"purchase\", is the main concern here. The installation request, although hardware-related, supports the purchase context. Thus, \"Purchase\" seems most fitting.\n\n\n"
