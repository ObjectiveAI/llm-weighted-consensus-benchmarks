My focus is on identifying keywords within the ticket descriptions to accurately map them to predefined options like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and others. I'm particularly honing in on phrases that indicate password-related issues to route them correctly.\n\n**Determining Ticket Classification**\n\nI'm currently focusing on identifying the primary issue within the provided ticket text. The recurring themes of password expiration and system change commands like \"Ctrl Alt Delete\" strongly suggest that \"Access\" is the most appropriate category, as it directly relates to account management and credential handling.\n\n**Refining Category Assignments**\n\nI'm refining the classification of IT tickets, focusing on the strongest indicators. The recurring emphasis on password expiration and the \"Ctrl Alt Delete\" sequence for system changes clearly points towards \"Access\" as the primary category for these requests.\n\n"
