The phrases \"allocation purchase request\" and \"purchase final owner\" are giving me strong signals. I'm leaning toward \"Purchase\" as the primary focus, but need to be certain that no other category is also relevant. I am working to eliminate any ambiguity.\n\n\n**Refining Category Selection**\n\nMy thinking has solidified around \"Purchase\" as the core category. The recurring \"purchase\" and \"request\" keywords dominate the text, leaving no room for doubt. I've methodically ruled out other categories like \"Hardware\" and \"Miscellaneous\", since they don't capture the essence of this particular ticket. My analysis is progressing in a focused manner; I'm eliminating irrelevant options to confirm \"Purchase\" as the accurate choice.\n\n\n"
