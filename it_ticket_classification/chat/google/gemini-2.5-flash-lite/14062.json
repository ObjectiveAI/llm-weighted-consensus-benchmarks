After analyzing the request for a \"list of all leavers,\" I'm leaning toward \"HR Support\" as the most suitable category. The request seems related to employee information, aligning with HR responsibilities.\n\n\n**Evaluating Candidate Categories**\n\nI've been honing my analysis of the ticket's core intent. My initial categorization of \"HR Support\" appears accurate. Now, I am refining my understanding of why, by closely examining keywords like \"leavers,\" \"accounts,\" and \"roles assigned.\" This indicates a strong HR function, and not strictly an access management issue.\n\n\n**Reconsidering Category Choice**\n\nI'm now certain that the ticket's core function revolves around HR support. While access and account deactivation are involved, the primary trigger is employee departure (\"leavers\"). This emphasizes the HR's role. My analysis of keywords and their context has solidified my position that this is fundamentally an HR-driven request. I'm focusing on the overall context and aim of the request, which is directly tied to the employee lifecycle.\n\n\n"
