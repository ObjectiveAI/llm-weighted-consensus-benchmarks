My current thinking is leaning towards \"Storage\" or \"Access\" as the most fitting categories, given the core issue described.\n\n**Refining Category Choices**\n\nI'm currently weighing \"Access\" versus \"Storage\" for this ticket. The phrase \"cannot access files\" strongly suggests an access issue, but the \"files lost\" aspect could also imply a deeper storage problem. I'm leaning towards \"Access\" as the most direct descriptor of the user's immediate predicament.\n\n**Identifying Core Issue**\n\nI'm currently analyzing the IT ticket, particularly the phrases \"files lost\" and \"cannot access files.\" My current inclination is that the core problem lies with the **Storage** of the files rather than simply an access permission issue.\n\n**Diagnosing File Inaccessibility**\n\nI'm currently deliberating between \"Access\" and \"Storage\" as the primary category. While \"cannot access files\" points to an access concern, the mention of \"files lost\" suggests a more fundamental issue with the underlying storage or data integrity. My current thought process is leaning towards \"Storage\" as the more encompassing classification for these symptoms.\n\n**Classifying Ticket Data**\n\nMy current thinking is focusing on the ticket's core complaint: \"files lost\" and \"cannot access files.\" I'm weighing \"Storage\" against \"Access,\" but the term \"lost\" strongly suggests a data availability issue, leaning me towards \"Storage\" as the primary classification.\n\n**Focusing on File Loss**\n\nI'm currently processing the IT ticket, specifically analyzing the phrases \"files lost\" and \"cannot access files.\" My current thinking is that these indicate a primary issue with **Storage**, rather than solely an access permissions problem.\n\n"
