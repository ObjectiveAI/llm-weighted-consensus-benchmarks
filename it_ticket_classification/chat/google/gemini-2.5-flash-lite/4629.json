The words \"access,\" \"cards,\" and \"employees\" stand out, making \"Access\" a strong contender. The context hints at usage beyond a typical timeframe, so \"Access\" seems to be the most fitting, but I need to make sure I don't overlook any other relevant elements. I am considering \"Miscellaneous\", if it does not fit the other categories.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and I think \"Access\" is most likely, due to \"access cards\" and usage. There is also reporting and data, but \"Access\" encapsulates the heart of the ticket better than the others. I also consider \"Miscellaneous\", but that is only if no other category fits. The words \"access,\" \"cards,\" and \"employees\" continue to stand out, pointing towards \"Access\" as the clear winner.\n\n\n**Confirming the Best Fit**\n\nI've been going through the text again, and \"Access\" remains the clear frontrunner. I've re-evaluated all categories, considering the \"internal audit\" aspect. The ticket focuses on reporting usage of access cards, which directly falls under \"Access\". The reporting is a means to manage and understand access, making \"Access\" the best fit.\n\n\n"
