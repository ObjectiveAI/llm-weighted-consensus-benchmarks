My focus is on identifying keywords and context clues within \"new starter center july pm re starter form hi attached form thought submitted\" to align it with one of the available IT ticket categories.\n\n**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nThe core of this ticket clearly revolves around a \"new starter\" and associated \"starter forms,\" indicating an onboarding process. While \"hardware\" is mentioned, it appears secondary to the primary HR-related administrative task of completing onboarding documentation for a July start. Therefore, I'm leaning heavily towards \"HR Support\" as the most fitting category.\n\n**Processing Starter Documentation**\n\nMy current focus is on processing the \"new starter\" and \"starter form\" content. The urgency and repeated mentions strongly point towards HR support, even with the minor inclusion of \"hardware.\" I am finalizing categorization based on this primary theme.\n\n"
