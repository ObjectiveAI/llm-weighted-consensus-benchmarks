So far, the wording is vague and doesn't explicitly point to a specific area. Keywords like \"code\" and \"contract\" suggest a technical nature, but it's not clear which IT sub-area is most relevant. I need to consider all the provided categories to find the best match for these details.\n\n\n**Refining Category Assignment**\n\nI've zeroed in on \"Internal Project\" as the best category for the ticket. The phrase \"project code\" coupled with \"contract signed\" strongly indicates an internal development or system modification.  While \"Purchase\" was a consideration due to the contract, the focus on code changes rules it out. I've also eliminated \"Administrative rights,\" \"Access,\" \"Hardware,\" \"Storage,\" and \"HR Support\" as they don't align with the ticket's core request.\n\n\n"
