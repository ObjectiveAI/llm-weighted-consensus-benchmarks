The system is designed to identify the appropriate category based on the keywords.\n\n\n**Revising Category Assignment**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket details, focusing on the keywords and the provided categories. After this reassessment, I'm sticking with \"Hardware\". The prevalence of monitor-related terms like \"re monitor,\" \"second monitor,\" and \"need monitor\" strongly points to a hardware issue or request, solidifying my initial categorization.\n\n\n"
