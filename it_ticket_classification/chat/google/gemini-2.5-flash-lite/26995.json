Further analysis is required.\n\n\n**Confirming Ticket Category**\n\nI've decided to categorize this ticket as \"HR Support.\" The \"new starter\" context, along with onboarding-related mentions like \"preferred name\" and \"logging him,\" strongly aligns with that category. While \"Access\" could be relevant, \"HR Support\" offers a broader fit for the overall onboarding process. \"Administrative rights\" is also considered, but \"HR Support\" is a more general fit and thus preferred.\n\n\n"
