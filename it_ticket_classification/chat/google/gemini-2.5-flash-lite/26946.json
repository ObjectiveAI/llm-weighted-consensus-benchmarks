However, I'm still considering \"Miscellaneous\" if the connection to HR is weak.\n\n\n**Finalizing Ticket Assignment**\n\nI've honed in on the HR Support category. The recent analysis of the ticket content, with phrases like \"direct reports\" and \"annual leave,\" solidly aligns it with human resources. The request seems to involve time-off and related reporting, firmly supporting this decision.\n\n\n"
