I'm leaning toward \"Hardware\" given the focus on monitors and their physical setup. The user's request appears to center around adjusting hardware for ergonomic reasons. I'm weighing this against the other options to ensure the best fit.\n\n\n**Categorizing the IT Request**\n\nI've refined my initial assessment. The provided ticket excerpt solidified my initial \"Hardware\" categorization. The repeated phrases like \"monitor raiser\" and \"monitors\" leave no doubt it's a hardware-related issue, and I've now categorized the ticket accordingly.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've honed in on the central issue: adjusting monitor height. It seems the core request centers around ergonomic needs. The repeated mention of \"monitor raiser\" and related terms reinforces the hardware focus. My assessment leans strongly towards \"Hardware\" as the most suitable category given the described context.\n\n\n**Selecting the Right Classification**\n\nI'm now fully confident in the \"Hardware\" categorization. The repetition of \"monitor raiser\" and related terms in the ticket description leaves no room for doubt. It's a clear case of needing to adjust physical IT equipment, making \"Hardware\" the most suitable choice. The phrases consistently relate to modifying monitor height, reinforcing my conclusion.\n\n\n"
