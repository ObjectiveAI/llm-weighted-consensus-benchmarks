The persistent mentions of re-sharing and troubleshooting client-side issues, even across different connection types, suggest it's not a straightforward hardware fault. I'm leaning towards it being an access-related or perhaps a more general miscellaneous issue requiring further investigation into permissions or configurations.\n\n**Classifying IT Issues**\n\nI'm currently focusing on identifying the core problem described in the ticket. My aim is to accurately assign it to the most fitting category, such as Access, by analyzing the user's inability to interact with shared files, which seems to be the primary issue.\n\n"
