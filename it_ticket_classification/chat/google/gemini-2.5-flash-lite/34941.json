The core issue seems to be related to uploading a referral tool, and the mention of \"installing flash\" suggests a potential dependency or compatibility problem, leaning towards a \"Hardware\" or perhaps \"Miscellaneous\" categorization given the nature of the tool and the browser plugin involved.\n\n**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nI'm still working to assign the most accurate category for this IT ticket. The problem, an issue with uploading a referral tool and a mention of \"installing flash,\" doesn't perfectly align with the provided options. I'm weighing \"Miscellaneous\" against the possibility of it being an \"Internal Project,\" as the nature of the tool is key.\n\n**Selecting Ticket Category**\n\nI'm finalizing the category for this IT ticket. Considering the focus on an issue with uploading a referral tool and the mention of \"installing flash,\" it appears to be a functional problem with an application. As it doesn't fit neatly into Hardware, HR, Access, Storage, Purchase, or Administrative rights, I'm leaning towards \"Miscellaneous\" or potentially \"Internal Project\" if the tool is internally developed.\n\n**Selecting Ticket Category**\n\nI've determined the best fit for this IT ticket. Given the issue with uploading a referral tool and the mention of a software dependency like \"flash,\" it doesn't align with hardware, HR, access, storage, purchase, or administrative rights. \"Miscellaneous\" serves as the most appropriate category for this specific application functionality problem.\n\n"
