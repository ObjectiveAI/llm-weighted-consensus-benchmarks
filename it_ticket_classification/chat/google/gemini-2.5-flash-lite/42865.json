The text indicates an issue with a visitor card not working, with a secondary request to activate something. I'm leaning towards \"Access\" as the primary category, but I'm open to further analysis for a more accurate classification. I'll need to consider \"HR Support\" if there is a HR process for these cards.\n\n\n**Defining Access Category**\n\nI've examined the ticket text and the available categories closely. The issue is definitively linked to the functionality and activation of visitor cards. While I considered \"Hardware\" due to potential card malfunctions, the essence lies in access control. \"HR Support\" seems unlikely unless visitor management is an HR process. Given the emphasis on activation, \"Access\" is the most fitting category, even if administrative rights play a role in the process. I am comfortable setting the category to \"Access\".\n\n\n"
