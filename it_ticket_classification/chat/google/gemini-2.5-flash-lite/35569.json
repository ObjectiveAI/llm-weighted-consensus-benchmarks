My analysis leans towards an access or administrative rights issue. I've noted the user's intent to \"raise\" something, which adds a layer of complexity but points to something the user needs. I\u2019m leaning towards \"Administrative Rights\" but need more info.\n\n\n**Pinpointing Ticket Category**\n\nI've zeroed in on the ticket's classification. The provided text strongly suggests an HR Support issue, specifically concerning timecard approvals and the associated notifications. I've ruled out other categories like hardware, access, and administrative rights. It's not a miscellaneous or internal project issue, as the focus is on a process problem, not a system development. The user's concern revolves around the approval system for timecards, making \"HR Support\" the appropriate category.\n\n\n"
