I've identified key phrases like \"leaver form,\" \"leaver,\" and \"submit leaver form,\" all suggesting an employee departure. My initial analysis points toward the \"Hardware\" category, but I'm considering if there's a more specific category within the schema that better fits the employee offboarding process. I need to consider it carefully.\n\n\n**Narrowing the Focus**\n\n\\n\\nI've analyzed the ticket text further and am leaning toward the \"HR Support\" category.  The phrase \"leaver form\" and its associated issues keep resurfacing.  Even though access is mentioned, the core problem is form-related, with issues like reminders and processing. \"HR Support\" seems like the most accurate fit within the provided categories, especially considering the typical HR involvement in offboarding procedures. I believe this is where this ticket belongs.\n\n\n"
