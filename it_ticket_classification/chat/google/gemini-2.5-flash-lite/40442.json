I'm trying to identify key terms like \"outage\" or \"notification\" to see if they narrow the focus. My initial leaning is towards \"Access,\" but I'm not ready to fully commit yet.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Access Issues**\n\nI've been analyzing the ticket text and it keeps pointing me toward Access. Even with the surrounding noise, \"unable to log on\" stands out as the core problem. The \"outage\" confirms it's a systemic problem, not a one-off. Although \"unavailable\" suggests systems are down, it's still about access. My focus is now on confirming whether an Access problem is the best fit from all available options.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Best Fit**\n\nI'm focused on the \"unable to log on\" aspect, which is central. Although the text has extraneous details, \"Access\" still stands out as the best fit. I've considered all the categories, but I'm solidifying my assessment to make sure I've got the most appropriate. I've considered the context, and it keeps bringing me back to the access.\n\n\n"
