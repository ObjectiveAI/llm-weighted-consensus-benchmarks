I'm confident in classifying it within that category, as it addresses a core HR-related request.\n\n\n**Finalizing the Classification**\n\nI've carefully considered the provided text and evaluated all potential IT ticket categories. Keywords like \"annual leave,\" \"leave allowance,\" and \"days remaining\" indicate a clear connection to HR processes. After reviewing the options, \"HR Support\" appears the most appropriate, as it directly addresses this employee benefits-related query. I'm satisfied this is the most accurate classification.\n\n\n"
