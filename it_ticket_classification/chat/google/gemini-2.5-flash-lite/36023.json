This feels like the most fitting category given the available options. I'm focusing on the context clues to identify the most relevant category.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Ticket**\n\nI've refined my initial analysis, and am now leaning heavily towards \"Administrative rights.\" The phrase \"able approve any change\" is a key indicator. It suggests a lack or misconfiguration of permissions, which is the crux of administrative rights. While \"Access\" could still be a consideration, \"Administrative rights\" encapsulates the issue with better precision.\n\n\n**Refining Category Determination**\n\nI'm now fully committed to \"Administrative rights.\" The phrase \"able approve any change\" is the smoking gun here. It strongly implies a permission issue - likely a user either having too broad permissions or a configuration problem. This points to the need for administrative rights in the system. The \"change approval issues\" and \"customer manager\" context further strengthen the choice.\n\n\n"
