While the keywords initially pointed to \"Access,\" the full context is crucial. The user explicitly requests help with connecting and working remotely, both of which strongly imply needing access to something. Despite considering hardware connections, the core problem seems rooted in broader connectivity and access to resources. \"Access\" still remains the most accurate fit.\n\n\n**Defining the Core Issue**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's text and have decided the primary issue is gaining *access*. Despite hints of hardware and connection, the central problem revolves around connecting, remote work, and mobile access. The term \"access\" is a direct match, and the user's struggle to connect strongly suggests this. I've ruled out other categories based on the lack of relevance to the reported problems.\n\n\n"
