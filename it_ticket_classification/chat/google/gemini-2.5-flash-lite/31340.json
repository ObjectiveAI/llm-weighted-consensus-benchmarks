There's no clear evidence for \"Internal Project,\" even though the flow could be part of one.  I'm now considering how best to justify this classification to be more explicit.\n\n\n**Defining Justification for Category**\n\nI've decided on \"Miscellaneous\" as the final category. I'm focusing now on constructing a clear justification for this classification. It's the only category that accurately reflects the text's ambiguous nature. While the \"oracle approval flow\" phrase hints at access or internal processes, the lack of specifics necessitates the broad \"Miscellaneous\" designation.  I'm outlining the key points to convey this effectively.\n\n\n"
