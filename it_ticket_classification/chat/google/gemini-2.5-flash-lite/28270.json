Based on the schema - Hardware, HR, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, or Admin - it looks like \"Hardware\" or \"Storage\" could be possibilities.  The ticket mentions RAM status which suggests hardware.\n\n\n**Defining the Problem Space**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the core problem within the ticket description. It's clear the issue centers around RAM capacity and allocation. Key phrases like \"ram full,\" \"allocate,\" and \"memory allocation\" all point to memory limitations being the root cause. This suggests a systemic issue with resource allocation rather than a hardware malfunction.\n\n\n**Narrowing the Focus**\n\nIt looks like I'm focusing on the action requested in the ticket. Based on the phrasing, it's about allocating or increasing RAM, but the specific target isn't clear. \"Hardware\" is still a contender, but now I'm considering if \"Storage\" is also appropriate because I could also look at how to reduce the amount of RAM currently being stored.\n\n\n**Finalizing the Classification**\n\nI'm now certain the ticket belongs under \"Hardware.\" The focus is on RAM capacity and allocation limits, directly impacting the machine's operational status. The keywords all point towards resource constraints. While \"Purchase\" might be a possible outcome, the phrasing \"allocate\" and \"increase\" suggests managing existing hardware resources is the immediate concern, aligning with the broader scope of the \"Hardware\" category.\n\n\n**Confirming Hardware Classification**\n\nI'm now fully committed to classifying this ticket under \"Hardware.\" The keyword \"allocate,\" repeatedly used alongside \"ram full,\" confirms the core issue relates to a hardware resource constraint. It looks like increasing the *allocation* of RAM is the primary concern, a direct function of the hardware category, even if increasing allocation could be a software change.\n\n\n**Categorizing the IT Request**\n\nI've finally settled on \"Hardware\" for this ticket. The phrases \"ram full,\" \"allocate,\" and \"memory allocation\" all point definitively to RAM capacity as the central issue. It's a resource constraint directly tied to the machine's hardware, demanding either an increase in physical RAM or a more efficient allocation of existing resources.\n\n\n"
