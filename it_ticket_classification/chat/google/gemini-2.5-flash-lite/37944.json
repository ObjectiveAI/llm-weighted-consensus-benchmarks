The time card details, approval process, and the \"rejected\" status strongly point toward \"HR Support\".  I'm confident this is the most accurate classification given the available options.\n\n\n**Defining the Ticket's Scope**\n\nMy analysis indicates a strong alignment with \"HR Support\". The content consistently mentions time-related tasks, such as time card submissions, approvals, rejections, and calendar views, which fall squarely within HR's domain. The other options, like \"Hardware\" or \"Access\", are clearly irrelevant to these functions. This conclusion is based on the keywords and the implied functions discussed in the ticket.\n\n\n"
