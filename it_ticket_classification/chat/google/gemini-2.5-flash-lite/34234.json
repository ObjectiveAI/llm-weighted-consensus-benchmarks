My focus is on analyzing the text and mapping its content, specifically mentions of \"roles and permissions to reports,\" to one of the established categories like Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, or Administrative rights.\n\n**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm refining the classification of this IT ticket. The key phrases about \"roles and permissions to reports\" and \"seeing other countries data\" strongly suggest an 'Access' category, specifically concerning data visibility and authorization within reporting systems.\n\n**Refining Access Categorization**\n\nI've confirmed that the ticket's core concern revolves around user access and permissions for reports, specifically data visibility issues across different countries and employee details. This firmly places it within the \"Access\" category.\n\n"
