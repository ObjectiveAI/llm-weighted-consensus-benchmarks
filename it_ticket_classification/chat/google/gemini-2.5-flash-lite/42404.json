I'm leaning towards \"Internal Project\" or possibly \"Access,\" as the issue seems related to project-specific permissions or a system glitch impacting project functionality. Still refining my approach.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Ticket Classification**\n\nMy current priority is definitively categorizing this ticket. Analyzing the text, I've identified the core issue revolves around project task visibility and start date adjustments within Oracle. \"Internal Project\" remains the leading contender, as the issue clearly involves project-related tasks, access, and potentially submission workflows. Though \"Access\" also is a possibility, the comprehensive nature of the project issue pushes \"Internal Project\" to the forefront. I'm focusing on the start date change's urgency and its possible implications for task submission.\n\n\n**Refining Ticket Categorization**\n\nMy focus has shifted to the urgent start date change and its impact on the project task submissions. While access issues may be involved, the core problem of task visibility within the project strongly suggests \"Internal Project\". The detailed analysis of the ticket's text, including the \"Oracle\" system involvement and need for ASAP changes to unlock submissions, reinforces this classification. I've ruled out all other categories due to their lack of direct relevance to project functionality and the required start date change.\n\n\n"
