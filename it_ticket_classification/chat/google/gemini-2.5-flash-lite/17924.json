                    "reasoning": "**Classifying Ticket Details**\n\nI'm currently focused on categorizing this IT ticket. The \"nominations\" keywords point me strongly toward either \"HR Support\" or potentially \"Internal Project\". I'll examine the context carefully to determine which category fits best.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Options**\n\nI've narrowed it down to \"HR Support\" and \"Access\", but leaning strongly towards HR. The user explicitly mentions \"people managers approving nominations\", and \"zone award nominations,\" pointing directly to HR functions. While access rights may be involved, the primary issue is the nomination process itself.\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nI'm now considering the subtleties of the \"Access\" and \"HR Support\" categories. While the user's issue involves approving nominations (HR), there's a strong access component. However, the core *request* seems to be about the ability to perform an HR-related task. Therefore, \"HR Support\" still feels more accurate. I'm focusing on whether the user's focus is on access as a means versus the purpose.\n\n**Clarifying Ticket's Purpose**\n\nI'm now focusing on the core issue: is the ticket about *how* to use the nomination system (HR Support) or *getting* access to it (Access/Admin Rights)? The description leans toward a process support request within HR, reinforced by the \"granted right approve\". I'm analyzing the implicit request to better determine the true intent of this ticket.\n\n\n**Determining Ticket's Core Issue**\n\nI'm now evaluating whether the primary concern is the HR function, specifically approving nominations, or the underlying access permissions required for this process. The phrase \"granted right approve\" is crucial here. I'm carefully analyzing the context to discern if the focus is on the *HR task itself* or on the *technical means* to achieve it. I need to understand whether this is process guidance or permission management.\n\n\n**Determining the Core Purpose**\n\nMy latest analysis focuses on whether the user's need relates to *gaining* access, or *using* an HR-related system to manage nominations. The \"granted right approve\" phrase is key. It now feels more like a direct request for *permission management* rather than seeking help on an HR process. I'm carefully considering how to frame the underlying request for access permissions.\n\n\n\n**Determining Primary Category**\n\nI'm now determining if the ticket is primarily about the underlying *access permissions* (Access/Admin Rights) or the *HR process* itself (HR Support). The request for \"granted right approve\" is crucial. While the context is HR-related, the ticket's core seems centered around managing access for the nomination system. I'm focusing on the technical aspect of permission allocation.\n\n\n**Refining Ticket's Core Purpose**\n\nI'm now focusing on whether the ticket revolves around *managing* permissions within the system or *facilitating* an HR process. Although the context is HR, the core seems to be about granting access rights, making \"Access\" a more accurate category than \"HR Support\" in this scenario.\n\n\n**Analyzing Ticket's Core Purpose**\n\nI'm now focusing on the ticket's true intent. While the HR context is clear, the request seems centered on granting permission to approve nominations. The key is \"granted right approve\". It's a system access request, not necessarily HR process guidance. Therefore, \"Access\" remains the most precise category.\n\n\n**Determining Primary Category**\n\nI've been re-evaluating the ticket's core intent. I'm prioritizing the underlying request to *grant permission* to a group, rather than the HR *function* itself. Considering the \"granted right approve\" phrase, and the ticket's focus on system access, I've decided **Access** best encapsulates the ticket's main purpose: to manage permissions within a system.\n\n\n"
