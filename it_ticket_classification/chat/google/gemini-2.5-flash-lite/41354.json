The phrase \"issue submitting time sheet\" suggests an HR-related problem, while \"incorrect data migration\" seems to pertain to data or potentially access. I'll need to weigh these possibilities to assign the most appropriate category.\n\n\n**Identifying the Best Fit**\n\nI've examined the key phrases in the ticket description. \"Issue submitting time sheet,\" \"incorrect data migration,\" and other phrases like \"try enter holiday get above hours\" all strongly suggest this falls under HR Support. Considering the provided list of categories, I've eliminated Hardware, Access, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights as they do not apply. HR Support covers timesheets, leave, and employee-related data, making it the clear choice.\n\n\n"
