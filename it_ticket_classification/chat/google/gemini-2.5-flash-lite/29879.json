I'm weighing how these details best align with the existing enum categories.\n\n**Identifying Connection Problems**\n\nI'm now focusing on the \"connections issues\" phrase. I'm assessing whether this points more towards a network access problem, fitting the \"Access\" category, or if it's broader and best categorized as \"Miscellaneous.\"\n\n**Determining Connection Category**\n\nI'm currently analyzing the ticket description, specifically focusing on \"connections issues\" and application mentions. I'm weighing whether this best fits under \"Access\" if it implies inability to reach a resource, or if it's a broader issue necessitating the \"Miscellaneous\" category.\n\n**Resolving Connection Queries**\n\nI'm currently assessing the IT ticket description, focusing on \"connections issues\" and application mentions.
