I've narrowed it down, and am leaning towards one specific category, considering the technical nature of the issue.\n\n\n**Finalizing Category Selection**\n\nI've determined that \"Access\" is the most accurate category. While \"Storage\" or \"Internal Project\" could be relevant, the core issue described is an inability to connect, which falls squarely under access problems. The provided text doesn't indicate any storage capacity concerns or project-specific limitations, further solidifying \"Access\" as the best fit.\n\n\n"
