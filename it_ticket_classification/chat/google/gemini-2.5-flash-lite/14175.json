While \"Access\" initially seemed most fitting due to the nature of licenses granting software utilization, I'm also strongly considering \"Purchase\" as the request to \"allocate\" could imply acquisition, necessitating a procurement workflow. I'm weighing which best reflects the immediate user need.\n\n**Choosing License Category**\n\nI'm currently deliberating between \"Access\" and \"Purchase\" for the \"pm license\" ticket. While \"Access\" reflects the outcome of using a license, the ambiguity in \"allocate\" leads me to consider that a purchase might be the prerequisite, thus favoring \"Purchase\" for broader workflow coverage.\n\n**Determining License Category**\n\nI'm currently focusing on the \"pm license\" request and weighing the most suitable category. While \"Access\" seems straightforward as licenses grant software utilization rights, the term \"allocate\" introduces an ambiguity that makes me strongly consider \"Purchase\" as a potential prerequisite.

My primary task is to assign it the most suitable category from the available options, focusing on the request to \"allocate\" a software license.\n\n**Refining Ticket Categorization**\n\nI'm currently evaluating the \"pm license\" request, focusing on distinguishing between \"Access\" and \"Purchase.\" While a license inherently grants access, the ambiguity of \"allocate\" prompts consideration of potential procurement, leading me to lean towards \"Purchase\" as a more comprehensive initial step if the license isn't readily available.\n\n**Assigning Software License**\n\nI'm currently evaluating the \"pm license\" IT ticket.
