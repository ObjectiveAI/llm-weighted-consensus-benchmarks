Initial analysis suggests potential connections to email or storage issues due to the mention of a \"mailbox.\" I am now focusing my analysis on pinpointing the main problem, which appears to be a full mailbox. I need to make sure this is correctly categorized, as it seems storage-related.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Issue**\n\nI've been analyzing the text for this IT ticket. The user has explicitly stated that the \"mailbox is full,\" therefore, the problem appears storage-related. I am further focusing my analysis, determining if this is an isolated case or a symptom of a larger problem. After examining the keywords \"mailbox\" and \"full,\" it seems the ticket is primarily a \"Storage\" issue.\n\n\n"
