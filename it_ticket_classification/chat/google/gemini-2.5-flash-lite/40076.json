After reviewing the text, \"leavers vs active AD accounts,\" I've narrowed it down. It seems related to user accounts and access. I'm leaning toward either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" but need to decide if access controls for user accounts is more relevant or the administrative actions performed on those accounts.\n\n\n**Analyzing the Ticket's Focus**\n\nAfter further analysis, I've eliminated \"Administrative rights\" and \"Internal Project.\" The focus is definitively on access revocation rather than project management. I am now certain \"Access\" is the most precise category. It directly addresses the core issue of disabling former employees' Active Directory accounts, thus preventing unauthorized system access. This operational task aligns perfectly with the \"Access\" category.\n\n\n**Finalizing the Categorization**\n\nI've rigorously assessed the options, including the pros and cons of \"Access\" versus alternatives like \"HR Support\" or \"Administrative Rights.\" The focus of the ticket boils down to access control \u2013 specifically, disabling AD accounts to prevent unauthorized system access. Although HR might initiate the need, the task itself is purely IT-related access management. This aligns perfectly with the \"Access\" category, as it addresses both the revocation of account access and the broader implication of securing systems.\n\n\n"
