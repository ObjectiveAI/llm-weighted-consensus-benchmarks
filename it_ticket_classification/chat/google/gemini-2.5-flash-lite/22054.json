The ticket's content clearly points toward managing machines' backups, not directly hardware, access, or HR. My instinct leans towards \"Storage\" due to the involvement of a backup server. I need to make sure the other categories are not more relevant.\n\n\n**Analyzing Ticket Category**\n\nI've confidently landed on \"Storage\" as the ideal category. The ticket text's focus on adding machines to a backup server solidifies this. While \"Hardware\" was initially considered, the core request revolves around data management, not the physical machines. I've ruled out other options like \"Miscellaneous\" due to their lack of specific relevance.\n\n\n"
