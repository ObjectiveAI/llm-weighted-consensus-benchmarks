Given the request to add new graphs and tables to a dashboard, and the mention of specific data like \"grades\" and \"job offers rejected,\" I'm leaning towards \"Miscellaneous\" as the most appropriate classification, as it doesn't clearly align with the other more specific options.\n\n**Categorizing Ticket Data**\n\nI'm currently refining my categorization of the IT ticket. While initially leaning towards \"Miscellaneous\" due to the dashboard modification aspect, the specific data points mentioned (\"grades,\" \"job offers rejected\") are strongly indicative of HR-related reporting. Therefore, I'm now re-evaluating \"HR Support\" as the more precise classification.\n\n**Reclassifying Ticket Data**\n\nI've reconsidered the IT ticket's categorization. While the initial task involves dashboard modifications, the explicit mention of \"grades\" and \"job offers rejected\" strongly suggests the underlying purpose is HR-related reporting. Therefore, I'm now classifying it under \"HR Support\" for greater accuracy.\n\n**Reclassifying Ticket Data**\n\nI've reconsidered the IT ticket's categorization.
