The key issue appears to be access-related, particularly with shared resources and file visibility. It is not about hardware, HR, storage, purchases, internal projects, or administrative rights, so I'm focusing on \"Access\" as the likely fit.\n\n\n**Refining Access Criteria**\n\nI'm solidifying my approach to classifying the ticket. The initial \"Access\" categorization still resonates, but I'm diving deeper into the nuances. Based on the ticket details, it's evident that the core problem revolves around shared report visibility and access. The user's inability to view the shared reports strongly suggests a permissions or access-related issue. This refined focus on access feels like the most probable fit.\n\n\n**Defining Access Issue Type**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the specific nature of this access problem. The user's description is very clear - it's about shared reports and not being able to see them, which is a symptom of access problems. I've ruled out hardware, HR, storage, purchases, internal projects, and administrative rights issues. Access, or more precisely, report access, is the clear culprit based on the provided text.\n\n\n"
