I've ruled out HR, Access, Storage, Purchase, and Internal Project issues. Administrative rights seems unrelated as well. \"Miscellaneous\" is a catch-all, but I think the hardware issue is the strongest candidate at this stage. I'll need to consider this in more depth before I commit.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Hardware Issue**\n\nI've homed in on \"Hardware\" as the likely culprit. I've re-examined the ticket details, focusing on \"laptop turned off suddenly\". While other categories were considered, none directly address the core issue. I've eliminated \"Miscellaneous\" as it's too broad, and identified that \"Hardware\" best represents the observed symptom, a sudden power-down.\n\n\n"
