My focus is on extracting keywords from the provided text to pinpoint the best fit amongst the available categories. The task at hand is to build a robust categorization model.\n\n\n**Prioritizing HR and Onboarding**\n\nI've just refined the categorization approach. Initially, the ticket's \"equipment\" mention leaned towards Hardware or Internal Project. However, by emphasizing \"starter form\" and \"onboarding,\" the alignment with HR Support becomes clearer. Keyword analysis points to HR processes.\n\n\n**Identifying Onboarding Focus**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the request's core. \"Bulk starter form\" and \"interns\" highlight an onboarding context. The emphasis is on facilitating new employee setup, a clear indicator of HR Support.\n\n\n**Determining the Core Request**\n\nI've just refined my reasoning. While \"equipment\" is mentioned, the repeated emphasis on the \"bulk starter form\" for interns points to an HR Support request. It's about initiating employee setup, not solely fixing hardware.\n\n\n**Refining Categorization Decision**\n\nI've just been grappling with the subtle nuances. Though \"equipment\" hinted at Hardware, the continuous emphasis on the \"bulk starter form\" for interns steered me back to HR Support. I'm now certain, given the ticket's nature, that HR-driven onboarding necessitates IT's assistance, thus solidifying the HR Support categorization.\n\n\n"
