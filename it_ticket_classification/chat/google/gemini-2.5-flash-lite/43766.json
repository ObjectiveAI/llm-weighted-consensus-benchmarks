                    "reasoning": "**Analyzing Ticket Details**\n\nOkay, I'm working on categorizing this IT ticket. The text seems sparse and a bit garbled, mentioning \"locked project field\" and a date. My initial thought is it could relate to Access issues, but I'm also considering Internal Project or Administrative Rights as potential fits. I need to weigh those options carefully.\n\n\n**Identifying the Root Cause**\n\nThe ticket's text analysis reveals a consistent pattern: locked or corrupted fields are the recurring culprit. Now, the emphasis is to pinpoint the exact category. We have clear evidence the issue stems from a locked field, but the context is still unclear. I'm leaning toward Access as a primary driver, possibly impacting Internal Project tasks, but I need to refine that to the most accurate fit.\n\n\n**Refining Category Selection**\n\nMy focus is narrowing in on the best category for this ticket. The initial Access seems right, since users can't modify fields. However, I'm now also strongly considering Internal Project, because of the \"locked project field\" reference. I'm leaning toward Access being the key driver, potentially impacting Internal Project tasks. The \"pre survey\" information suggests this could be part of a survey or project. I'll need to weigh these two options carefully to choose the most accurate fit.\n\n\n**Revisiting Category Choices**\n\nI've been re-evaluating the ticket, giving Internal Project and Access another look. While the project reference is there, the core problem's still access: \"locked field,\" \"can't access.\" It seems like the access restriction is preventing the project function from working, making \"Access\" a more fundamental fit. The pre-survey failure supports this; it's a consequence of the locked field, not the root. I'm leaning heavily towards \"Access\" now.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've been going back and forth, but I'm leaning heavily towards \"Access\" being the best fit. While \"Internal Project\" is still a possibility because of the \"locked project field\" reference, the repeated emphasis on the user's inability to access and manipulate fields (\"can't access,\" \"locked field\") is the strongest indicator. The pre-survey failure is a consequence, confirming a primary access issue. So the emphasis is now on this category.\n\n\n**Defining the Primary Cause**\n\nOkay, after significant review, I've chosen \"Access\" as the core category. While \"Internal Project\" felt relevant initially, the emphasis on locked fields and the user's inability to interact with the system's components is the deciding factor. \"Access\" is the most direct fit.\n\n\n**Reconciling Context and Cause**\n\nI've been going back and forth, but I'm leaning heavily towards \"Internal Project\" now. While \"Access\" is relevant, the initial \"locked project field\" clearly roots the issue in a project context. The survey failures and Excel issues reinforce this project focus, indicating system or configuration problems within an internal project.\n\n\n**Choosing Project Focus**\n\nI've been going back and forth, but I'm settling on \"Internal Project.\" Although access is blocked, the ticket's focus seems to center around a \"locked project field\" related to a survey campaign. While \"Access\" is a clear issue, the system malfunction or configuration's likely tied to this internal project.\n\n\n**Identifying Project Impact**\n\nThe issue's now firmly about an \"Internal Project.\" I'm sure the core problem is access, I believe, based on the \"locked project field\" reference. The repeated inability to access or modify data is the main concern. Still, the campaign aspect strongly suggests a faulty tool or system within an Internal Project context, rather than a general access problem.\n\n\n**Deciding on Primary Category**\n\nI'm now firmly focused on \"Internal Project.\" While access limitations are present, the core issue stems from the \"locked project field\" related to the pre-survey. Excel data mix-ups and system failures strongly suggest a project-related malfunction. Access is now a secondary symptom of this underlying project problem.\n\n\n**Deciding on Primary Category**\n\nI'm now settling on \"Internal Project.\" While the initial \"locked project field\" triggered \"Access,\" the campaign's context and system failures suggest a deeper Internal Project issue. Access is likely impacted by the underlying project malfunction.\n\n\n**Re-evaluating System Malfunction**\n\nI'm now focusing on \"Internal Project.\" While the initial \"Access\" considerations were valid, the recurring mention of \"project field,\" \"pre survey,\" and \"Excel fields\" points to a system malfunction within an internal project or campaign. I'm prioritizing the context of a faulty internal tool, rather than a general access problem.\n\n\n"
