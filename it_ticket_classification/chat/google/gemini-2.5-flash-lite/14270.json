Based on the text, \"new starter\" and \"please fill date,\" my current thinking leans towards \"HR Support\" or potentially \"Administrative rights\" if the new starter needs access to systems. I'm focusing on keywords and phrases to make the best determination.\n\n\n**Refining Ticket Categorization**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket text with the key phrase \"new starter\". Considering the available categories, \"HR Support\" seems most fitting, as the request likely stems from onboarding procedures. \"Access\" is a close second, as new employees often need system access. While \"Hardware\" is possible, it's less specific than the other options. The remaining categories seem irrelevant given the \"new starter\" context and the incomplete nature of the remainder of the text.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Best Fit**\n\nI'm now focusing on how the \"new starter\" context influences the best category. Considering \"new starter,\" and after reevaluating the text's fragmented details, \"HR Support\" appears the most encompassing. It broadly covers the onboarding process implied by \"new starter,\" even with the minimal textual clues. While \"Access\" is closely linked, HR typically coordinates new hire setup including access. The remaining categories appear less relevant given the core request.\n\n\n**Focusing on Onboarding Context**\n\nI'm now focusing on how the term \"new starter\" defines the best category to assign to this ticket. Given the available options, and the likely workflow a new hire triggers within an organization, \"HR Support\" seems the most appropriate. It's an umbrella for onboarding-related actions. While access might be included, HR often initiates this type of setup.\n\n\n"
