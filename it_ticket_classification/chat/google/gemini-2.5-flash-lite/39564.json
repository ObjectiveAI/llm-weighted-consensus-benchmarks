My focus is on extracting key terms, like \"internship,\" to accurately map it to the most fitting category from the available options. I'm aiming for precision in this initial classification.\n\n**Determining the Category**\n\nMy analysis points towards \"HR Support\" as the most fitting classification for this ticket. The content strongly suggests issues related to employee processes, specifically internship timecards and submission protocols, which fall squarely under HR responsibilities.\n\n**Refining Category Choice**\n\nMy current focus is on confirming the most precise category for the ticket. While \"HR Support\" strongly aligns with the operational and procedural elements of internship timecards and submissions, I am also considering any subtle implications that might lean towards \"Access\" if modifications to past intern credentials are a secondary concern. However, the primary thrust remains firmly within HR's purview.\n\n"
