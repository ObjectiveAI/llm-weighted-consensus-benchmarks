Initial attempts are leaning towards \"Miscellaneous,\" but I'm trying to refine my rules to better distinguish between that and \"HR Support.\" There seems to be a subtle difference between requests that are strictly administrative and those involving employee tasks, but I'm getting closer to a solid decision. I'm focusing on the context clues.\n\n\n**Determining the Core Action**\n\nI've been analyzing the ticket text, focusing on identifying the primary request. While \"annual leave requests\" appeared, the core action seems to be about modifying a project allocation. This points strongly towards \"Internal Project\" as the appropriate category. I'm prioritizing the main action of the request to categorize this.\n\n\n**Analyzing Main Request Focus**\n\nI'm now prioritizing \"project allocation\" as the core element. While HR aspects are present, the primary task here is project assignment modification. The repeated term \"allocation\" confirms this emphasis, further solidifying \"Internal Project\" as the appropriate category. I'm focusing on the single, core action.\n\n\n"
