My current approach involves weighting keywords like these to determine the best-fit category, which appears to be a good starting point. I'm exploring how different combinations of keywords impact the final categorization.\n\n\n**Identifying Ticket Focus**\n\nI've analyzed the ticket details and identified the core issue as a problem within the \"Purchase\" process. The mentions of \"oracle fusion service,\" \"purchase requests,\" and \"requisitions\" solidified this conclusion. While the system improvement exercise on categories is also present, the direct impact on \"Purchase\" operations makes it the primary focus. I'm confident that the \"Purchase\" category is the best fit.\n\n\n"
