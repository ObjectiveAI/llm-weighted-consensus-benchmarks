After analyzing the text, the phrase \"new starter\" points strongly toward the \"HR Support\" category, as it relates to employee onboarding. I'm confident this is the best fit, but I'll double-check to be sure no other category is more applicable.\n\n\n**Revising Category Choice**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket text with the potential for misinterpretation in mind. While \"new starter\" initially pointed toward HR Support, the inclusion of \"termination\" raises the possibility of an Access issue. Could an incorrect termination date have affected an employee's access rights? I am leaning back toward \"Access\" or \"HR Support\" now, so I'll prioritize these categories in further analysis.\n\n\n**Pinpointing HR Alignment**\n\nI've decided to prioritize HR Support as the correct category. The \"new starter\" and \"termination\" mentions strongly suggest employee lifecycle management is the central focus here. There seems to be an error within the HR system or process, not just an access issue. I am confident \"HR Support\" is the right call.\n\n\n"
