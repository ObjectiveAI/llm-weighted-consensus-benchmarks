However, I need to carefully consider all categories before reaching a conclusion. I'm carefully reviewing the options to ensure I do not make a misstep.\n\n\n**Confirming Category Choice**\n\nI've finished the analysis, and the evidence points definitively to \"HR Support.\" The keywords like \"annual leave,\" \"vacation,\" and \"leave allowance\" are all clear indicators. The user needs help with leave request management, which is squarely within the HR domain. I am now confident.\n\n\n"
