I think I'm leaning toward an Access-related category, because adding members to a project and tracking that time could be permissions or access control. I'm still weighing the options, but this is the current hypothesis.\n\n\n**Narrowing the Focus**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on \"Internal Project\" as the primary category. The \"track time,\" \"project team,\" and \"adding members\" aspects all strongly suggest project management activities. While \"Access\" could be a secondary consideration due to user permissions, the core request is managing a project team, making Internal Project the most fitting. I'm exploring related subcategories to refine this further.\n\n\n**Analyzing the Text**\n\nI've carefully dissected the ticket text, prioritizing phrases like \"track time,\" \"project team,\" and \"adding new members.\" The emphasis is clearly on project management, with Oracle mentioned as a project-specific identifier. This solidified \"Internal Project\" as the best fit, while recognizing \"Access\" might be relevant secondarily. I'm now exploring how to classify this ticket's specific intent.\n\n\n"
