Based on the provided text about adding a commission type to a screen, I'm leaning toward \"Miscellaneous\" or potentially \"Internal Project.\" This requires further analysis to determine the primary nature of the request.\n\n\n**Analyzing Project Scope**\n\nThe categorization continues, now focusing on the ticket's scope. Considering the phrase \"add commission type to the screen,\" the focus leans towards \"Internal Project.\" This is because the task involves a modification or enhancement to an existing application, rather than a generic support or hardware issue. The phrase \"modification or enhancement\" feels relevant. \"Miscellaneous\" remains a possibility but is less specific than \"Internal Project\" given the development nature of adding types and display.\n\n\n**Finalizing Categorization Decision**\n\nI've carefully re-examined the ticket details, now leaning strongly toward \"Internal Project.\" The additions requested\u2014commission types, allocation types, dropdown selections, and commission schemes\u2014point directly to modifying an existing application's functionality. While \"Miscellaneous\" was considered, the technical nature of adding business logic makes \"Internal Project\" a more precise fit. This task sounds precisely like an internal development request.\n\n\n**Defining the Scope Further**\n\nI'm now fully committed to \"Internal Project.\" The addition of commission types, allocation types, and \"scheme\" all point to specific business logic implementations. These additions go beyond simple data display, indicating a development or modification of an existing application. The ticket request, which is adding the capabilities and visual elements, leans heavily towards this specific categorization.\n\n\n"
