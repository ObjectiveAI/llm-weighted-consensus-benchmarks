So far, the phrases \"maternity leave\" and \"submission for maternity leave\" have caught my attention, which seem to suggest it's more HR-related, rather than IT hardware or software, and I'm leaning toward HR Support.\n\n\n**Confirming HR Designation**\n\nI've reviewed the language in the ticket once more. The emphasis on \"maternity leave,\" \"submission,\" and \"absence\" makes \"HR Support\" the clear best fit. I've noted that the phrase \"update person record\" further reinforces the HR domain. The ticket's content doesn't pertain to hardware, access, storage, or any other category, solidifying my decision.\n\n\n"
