Analyzing the text, my initial instinct leans toward \"HR Support\" due to the mention of \"absences\" and \"leave.\" I'm also considering potential overlaps with \"Access\" given the mention of submission issues, but HR seems the more likely fit.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Ticket**\n\nI've zeroed in on the \"HR Support\" category as the best fit. The leave and absence-related language in the ticket are strong indicators. While there's a minor aspect of access, the core concern clearly falls under HR. The ticket text strongly suggests a human resources-related matter concerning leave submission and absence codes.\n\n\n"
