The schema clearly outlines the single mandatory field, `category`, and I'm reviewing the defined enum values (\"Hardware\", \"HR Support\", \"Access\", \"Miscellaneous\", \"Storage\", \"Purchase\", \"Internal Project\", \"Administrative rights\") to determine the most appropriate classification.\n\n**Selecting Ticket Category**\n\nI've reviewed the ticket's content, noting mentions of \"display errors,\" \"issue displaying data,\" and \"oracle information.\" Coupled with references to \"profile,\" \"line manager career,\" and \"career,\" these strongly indicate an issue related to HR data and employee profiles. Therefore, I'm leaning towards \"HR Support\" as the most fitting category.\n\n**Refining Ticket Categorization**\n\nI've concluded that the ticket's focus on profile and career display errors strongly aligns with HR functions. Therefore, I am confident in classifying this as an \"HR Support\" ticket based on the provided schema and ticket content.\n\n"
