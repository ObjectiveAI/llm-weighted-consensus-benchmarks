So far, the phrase \"connection failed\" seems like a key indicator. I'm leaning toward either \"Access\" or potentially \"Hardware\", but I want to be certain before I commit.\n\n\n**Determining the Root Cause**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and I'm quite certain that it points to an access problem. The user's inability to connect, whether wired or wireless, indicates a network access issue rather than a hardware malfunction. I'm focusing my attention on how the access issue manifests. It's important to consider why the user can't access network resources.\n\n\n**Revisiting Category Assignment**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket, focusing on the phrase \"connection failed\". After considering all the categories, \"Access\" still seems most appropriate. My thinking is now centered on solidifying this conclusion. I want to ensure my reasoning is airtight and that no other category could be a better fit given the provided text.\n\n\n"
