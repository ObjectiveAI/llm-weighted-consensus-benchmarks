The prompt is centered around annual leave, which should go under \"HR Support\". The provided schema seems pretty straightforward, so I'll output a JSON object with that information.\n\n\n**Categorizing the IT Ticket**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the ticket description, identifying recurring keywords and phrases like \"annual leave,\" \"timecard,\" and \"submit cards.\" It's becoming increasingly clear that the crux of this issue lies within HR-related processes. Therefore, I'm confident that the \"HR Support\" category is the most fitting selection. I'm now drafting the JSON output to reflect this determination.\n\n\n**Defining the Best Fit**\n\nI'm now fully immersed in the ticket details, isolating and highlighting the most pertinent keywords and concepts. It's evident the query deals exclusively with timecard submissions, annual leave management, and adjustments. This makes \"HR Support\" the definitive category, as these are HR-driven procedures related to employee data. The JSON output will be straightforward.\n\n\n"
