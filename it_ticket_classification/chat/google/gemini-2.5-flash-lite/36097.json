The text \"problems with referring a candidate\" is proving to be a bit ambiguous, but I'm leaning toward an initial classification of \"HR Support\" given the context of \"referral\". However, \"Access\" is also a possibility if the problem is related to accessing a system for referrals. I am still investigating.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Best Fit**\n\nI've carefully analyzed the ticket content and have decided that \"HR Support\" is indeed the most appropriate category, given the emphasis on the referral process. While \"Access\" could be relevant if it involved system access, the core issue seems to be a process-related problem. I've ruled out the remaining categories after considering their applicability.\n\n\n**Defining the Optimal Category**\n\nI've thoroughly analyzed the ticket and believe \"HR Support\" is the most appropriate category. The content details issues with candidate referrals and requisitions, aligning directly with HR processes. While \"Access\" could be a consideration, the core issue centers on the referral process itself, not necessarily system access problems. All other categories are irrelevant. I'm ready to classify it now.\n\n\n"
