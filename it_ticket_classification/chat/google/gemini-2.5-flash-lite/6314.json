My current thinking leans towards this being a request related to granting specific permissions or roles, making \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" the most probable categories.\n\n**Determining Ticket Classification**\n\nI'm currently analyzing the provided text, focusing on the phrase \"set am as owners to users.\" My immediate inclination is that this signifies a request to manage roles or permissions. Therefore, I'm leaning towards categorizing it under \"Administrative rights\" as it most accurately reflects the act of assigning ownership.\n\n**Assigning User Permissions**\n\nI'm focused on interpreting the phrase \"set am as owners to users\" to determine the most fitting category.
