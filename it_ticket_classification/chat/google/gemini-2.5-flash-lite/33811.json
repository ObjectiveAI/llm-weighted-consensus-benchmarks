I'm leaning toward \"Internal Project\" or possibly \"Access\" given the mention of a \"schema\" and \"progress done\". The specifics are still a bit vague, so I'm re-reading the details to refine.\n\n\n**Refining Category Selection**\n\nMy focus is narrowing in on the best category for this ticket. The core theme is still pointing firmly towards \"Internal Project\", given the repeated mentions of changes related to a schema, story, task, progress, and resolution. While there's a strong emphasis on changes, that doesn't necessarily mean it is an access request. The other categories seem to not match as well. I'm solidifying my assessment to \"Internal Project\".\n\n\n**Categorizing the IT Ticket**\n\nThe ticket's text, while brief, clearly centers on project-related changes. Keywords like \"schema,\" \"story,\" \"task,\" and \"progress\" strongly suggest internal development activities. Based on the phrasing, an \"Internal Project\" is the best fit, while also noting that the other categories are not as obvious. The project appears to be a change of the schema that affects the stories and tasks being worked on, and the ticket is tracking progress and resolution of this change.\n\n\n"
