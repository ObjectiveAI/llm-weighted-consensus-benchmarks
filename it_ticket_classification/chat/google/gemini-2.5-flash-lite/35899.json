The noise on the line is clearly disrupting daily calls. I'm leaning toward a category that reflects the core problem: a technical malfunction hindering effective communication. Considering the options, I believe a hardware-related issue is the most likely culprit.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Issue**\n\nThe analysis points decisively towards a hardware issue as the root of the sound quality problems. I've ruled out other categories, like HR support and administrative rights, as irrelevant. While purchase is indirectly linked if a fix is needed, the focus is on the malfunctioning hardware itself. Hardware is the most accurate classification.\n\n\n"
