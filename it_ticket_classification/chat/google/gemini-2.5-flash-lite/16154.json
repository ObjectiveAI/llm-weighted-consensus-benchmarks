I'm building a system to extract key signals that will allow accurate matching based on semantic meaning of the ticket text. The goal is to accurately translate the written content into a usable category. I'm exploring different approaches to ensure the category selection adheres to the defined structure.\n\n\n**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm zeroing in on the appropriate category for the ticket. My analysis of the text, focusing on keywords like \"new starter\", \"admin\", \"starter form\", \"assigned her,\" and \"fill starter form,\" points towards \"Access,\" and \"HR Support.\" It's clear this involves onboarding a new employee and granting them necessary access. I'm leaning toward \"HR Support\" because the described actions often originate from HR departments to set up new employee accounts and access. I'm ensuring the final classification aligns precisely with the defined schema.\n\n\n**Finalizing Category Selection**\n\nI'm now confident in the final category. My analysis, focusing on \"new starter,\" \"admin,\" \"starter form,\" and \"fill starter form,\" indicates this is about onboarding a new employee. While \"Access\" is relevant, \"HR Support\" provides a broader context for the onboarding process. After reviewing, I've determined that \"HR Support\" best encompasses the request to provision new employee resources. I've validated this aligns precisely with the defined schema.\n\n\n**Choosing Ticket Category**\n\nI've considered all the clues and I'm settling on \"HR Support\" for this ticket. The user described onboarding tasks strongly indicate \"Access,\" but \"HR Support\" has a wider scope. It addresses the broader process of onboarding new employees, which often includes granting the relevant \"Access\". The phrase \"new starter admin\" and  \"starter form\" strongly suggests setting up a new user, and I've validated this selection against the schema.\n\n\n"
