I'm carefully considering how to resolve any ambiguity.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the ticket content, which revolves around \"oracle duplicate holiday entries.\" Despite the \"oracle\" mention, the crux is HR-related: holiday entries and adjustments, annual leave, special leave, and related data. I've considered several categories, concluding that \"HR Support\" best fits this.\n\n\n"
