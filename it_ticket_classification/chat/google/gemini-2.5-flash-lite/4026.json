Based on the ticket text, my initial assessment suggests a trend leaning towards application upgrades related to user notifications and hub version enhancements. It looks like \"Black Duck\" is a key component. I'm actively refining the decision-making process to account for more nuanced categorization.\n\n\n**Assessing Internal Project Focus**\n\nI've re-evaluated the ticket text, and now I'm leaning heavily towards \"Internal Project\" as the primary category. The discussion of \"Black Duck Hub\" application upgrades, feature additions (licenses, comparisons, dashboards, vulnerability guidance), and \"planned works\" strongly suggests an ongoing internal project. While \"Access\" could be a secondary consideration due to permission-related mentions, the core emphasis seems to be the development and enhancement of the \"Black Duck\" hub.\n\n\n**Revising Ticket Classification**\n\nHaving reviewed the ticket text more closely, my focus shifted. While permissions were mentioned, the core theme is internal application development. The consistent references to \"Black Duck Hub,\" its upgrade, new features (licenses, comparison, dashboards, vulnerability guidance), and \"planned works\" firmly establish this as an internal project update. The \"Access\" category is secondary to the primary function, which is the enhancement and communication about the \"Black Duck\" hub.\n\n\n"
