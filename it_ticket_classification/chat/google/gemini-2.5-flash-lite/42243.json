I've noted \"broken patch cords\" and \"meeting room\" as key pieces of information. It seems likely this relates to a hardware issue, but I need to consider the broader context before making a final determination.\n\n\n**Confirming Hardware Diagnosis**\n\nI've reviewed the IT ticket's details again. The \"broken patch cords\" in the \"meeting room\" combined with the broken latching tab confirm this is a straightforward hardware issue. The initial assessment was correct; \"Hardware\" is the most accurate category for this request.\n\n\n"
