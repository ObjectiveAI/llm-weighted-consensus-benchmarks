My focus is on the phrases \"career added to the reports\" and \"reports added reports\" to determine if it relates to hardware, HR, access, or another relevant area.\n\n**Determining Report Modification Category**\n\nI'm currently evaluating the IT ticket description, focusing on the recurring terms \"reports\" and \"add column\" to pinpoint its category. My analysis suggests a strong lean towards managing or modifying report structures, with a secondary consideration for \"storage\" due to the mention of \"storage report.\" I'm weighing whether this falls under a specific category or needs to be classified as Miscellaneous.\n\n**Refining Report Categorization**\n\nI'm refining my categorization by prioritizing the recurring themes of \"reports\" and \"add column.\" While \"storage report\" appears, the primary focus seems to be on modifying report structures. I'm considering whether this falls under a specific reporting category or warrants a \"Miscellaneous\" classification.\n\n**Analyzing Report Modification Needs**\n\nI'm currently processing the IT ticket description, giving priority to the repeated mentions of \"reports\" and \"add column.\" While \"storage report\" is also noted, the core seems to revolve around augmenting existing report structures with additional data points. I'm assessing if \"Storage\" is the most fitting category, given the specific report type mentioned, or if a more general \"Miscellaneous\" classification is warranted.\n\n**Focusing on Storage Report Modifications**\n\nI'm currently analyzing the IT ticket description. My primary focus is on the repeated mentions of \"reports\" and the specific phrase \"storage report,\" combined with the request to \"add column.\" I'm evaluating if \"Storage\" is the most fitting category, given the subject matter of the report mentioned.\n\n**Analyzing Storage Report Modifications**\n\nI'm currently analyzing the IT ticket description, with a strong focus on the phrase \"storage report\" and the request to \"add column.\" This leads me to believe the core of the request involves modifications to reports concerning storage data, making \"Storage\" the most fitting category.\n\n**Categorizing Report Modifications**\n\nI'm currently refining the categorization of the IT ticket description. My focus has narrowed to the specific mention of \"storage report\" alongside the recurring theme of \"add column,\" suggesting the ticket relates to modifications of reports pertaining to storage data. I'm leaning towards the \"Storage\" category as the most suitable classification for this request.\n\n"
