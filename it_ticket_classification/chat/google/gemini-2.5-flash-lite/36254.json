I am ready to tag this ticket.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Best Match**\n\nI've determined the best category for this ticket is \"HR Support,\" based on phrases related to \"time card hours,\" and \"submit worked hours.\" My next step is to format this information correctly, as a JSON object, with the category being the only key. I'm ready to prepare the final output.\n\n\n"
