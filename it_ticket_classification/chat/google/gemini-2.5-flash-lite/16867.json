Currently, I'm leaning towards \"HR Support\" since the phrases used seem connected to an employee departing. The terms \"leaver,\" \"mobile phone,\" and \"mailbox\" are key indicators for this classification. I'm double-checking, but it seems to fit best.\n\n\n**Confirming HR Alignment**\n\nI'm now fully confident that the ticket falls under \"HR Support.\" The terms \"leaver,\" \"mobile phone,\" and \"mailbox\" strongly suggest this. This aligns perfectly with the standard procedure of HR managing departing employee assets, like mobile phones and mailboxes. While \"Access\" could be related, the core issue stems from an employee leaving, making \"HR Support\" the most accurate categorization.\n\n\n**Finalizing Category Selection**\n\nI've thoroughly analyzed the ticket, and the \"HR Support\" category is now confirmed as the best fit. The \"leaver\" context and references to mobile phone and mailbox management align perfectly with typical HR-driven offboarding procedures. The initial inclination was correct, and I'm confident in this final categorization.\n\n\n"
