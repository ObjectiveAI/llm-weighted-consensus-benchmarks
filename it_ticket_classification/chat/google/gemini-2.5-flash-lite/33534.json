After analyzing the text, I'm leaning towards \"Hardware\" or \"Purchase,\" as cables seem to be the central issue. I'm carefully considering the context to make a final decision, keeping in mind the available categories like \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" etc.\n\n\n**Categorizing Ticket: Final Decision**\n\nI've made the final call, settling on \"Hardware\" as the best fit. While \"Purchase\" was a contender, the focus seems to be on needing those specific components to *function*, rather than just acquiring them. The recurring terms of \"cables\" and \"monitor\", and specifically the need to \"connect\" them, solidified this categorization.\n\n\n**Finalizing Ticket Category**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket details, now leaning heavily towards \"Hardware\" as the definitive category. While \"Purchase\" was considered given the apparent need for new cables, the emphasis appears to be on getting those components connected and working. Keywords like \"connect\" and \"monitor\" solidify that the primary issue concerns the physical hardware setup, making \"Hardware\" the most precise choice.\n\n\n"
