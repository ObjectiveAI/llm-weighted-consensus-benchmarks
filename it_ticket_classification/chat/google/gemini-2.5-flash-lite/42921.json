The reference to \"cert weak signature algorithm\" strongly suggests a security-related problem, not hardware. It seems like the user is facing a connection issue with meet.com caused by a potential security breach attempt. I'm leaning toward a category related to security protocols or network configurations.\n\n**Analyzing Access Problems**\n\nI've homed in on \"Access\" as the fitting category for this ticket, given the user's trouble accessing a meet.com meeting and the accompanying \"cert weak signature algorithm\" error. It's a connection issue, not a hardware fault. The certificate error and the alert of a security threat solidify \"Access\" as the primary concern. Now, I will refine the sub-category of \"Access\".\n\n\n"
