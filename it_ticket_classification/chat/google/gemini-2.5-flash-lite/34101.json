After analyzing the provided content, specifically the mention of \"primary router\" and a network issue, it seems most appropriate to categorize this under \"Hardware\". I am now seeking confirmation of this category.\n\n\n**Defining the Category**\n\nI've carefully reviewed the IT ticket's content, focusing on keywords and phrases. The mentions of \"primary router,\" \"peer session down,\" and \"circuit went down\" strongly point towards a \"Hardware\" issue, specifically concerning networking hardware. I've concluded that the \"Hardware\" category is the most fitting classification for this ticket.\n\n\n"
