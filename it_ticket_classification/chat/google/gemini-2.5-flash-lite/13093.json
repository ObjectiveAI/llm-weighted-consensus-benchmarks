I need to figure out what \"pm\" refers to, since that's crucial. I'm thinking it's likely a system or a role. \"Planning responsible accept decline\" suggests a workflow or permission management related to planning. Time to investigate!\n\n\n**Defining the Ticket Type**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the correct category. After comparing the ticket description, \"wants to access planning pm wants planning responsible accept decline,\" to the possible categories, I'm leaning heavily towards \"Access.\" While \"Internal Project\" could apply depending on how planning is defined, \"Access\" directly reflects the user's primary need. \"Administrative rights\" might be relevant, but it seems secondary to the core request for system access.\n\n\n**Reiterating Access Needs**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket's core request. The focus is undeniably access-oriented. The \"planning responsible accept decline\" aspect reinforces the need for access, emphasizing the workflow around granting or denying that access. \"Access\" is a more precise fit than \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights,\" which are secondary. Categorizing it this way ensures the right team gets involved.\n\n\n"
