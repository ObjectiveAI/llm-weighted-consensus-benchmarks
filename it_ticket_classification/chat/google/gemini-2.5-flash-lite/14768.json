My process involves dissecting the core request within the ticket and mapping it to the available options: \"Hardware\", \"HR Support\", \"Access\", \"Miscellaneous\", \"Storage\", \"Purchase\", \"Internal Project\", and \"Administrative rights\".\n\n**Analyzing Dashboard Management Needs**\n\nMy recent focus has been on identifying the dominant themes within the ticket text. It appears the core request revolves around managing and configuring dashboards, with several mentions of \"dashboard\" and \"boards.\" I'm also noting keywords related to visibility, components, and potentially administrative changes to these boards.\n\n**Modifying Access Levels**\n\nMy recent analysis indicates that the core of this request centers on modifications to administrative privileges and ownership of dashboards. The recurring themes of changing administrators, owners, and managing the visibility and structure of boards strongly suggest the \"Administrative rights\" category.\n\n**Modifying Administrative Permissions**\n\nMy analysis of the ticket text confirms that the primary focus is on managing administrative permissions for dashboards. Recurring phrases like \"change administrators\" and \"change owner,\" alongside tasks such as renaming and reordering dashboard components, strongly align with the \"Administrative rights\" category.\n\n"
