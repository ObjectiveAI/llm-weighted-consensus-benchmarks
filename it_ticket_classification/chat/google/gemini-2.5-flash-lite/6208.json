The focus on \"timecard\" and the action \"delete\" aligns perfectly with typical HR-related tasks. Though \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights\" are related, the core issue is the management of timecard data, a primary function of HR departments. Thus, \"HR Support\" best captures the essence of the ticket.\n\n\n"
