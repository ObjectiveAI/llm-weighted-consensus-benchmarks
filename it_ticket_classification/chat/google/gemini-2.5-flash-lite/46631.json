                    "reasoning": "**Assessing the Ticket**\n\nI'm currently focused on the single provided sentence. \"Oracle not displayed\" is the only thing to work with, right? My initial thought is to categorize this as an Access issue. I will keep exploring this to confirm.\n\n\n**Defining the Core Problem**\n\nI'm now identifying the key issues within the various sentences provided. There are clear access problems relating to broken items that cannot be opened, coupled with approval issues concerning sheets. \"Oracle not displayed\" also suggests a software component issue. I need to synthesize these elements to pinpoint the most accurate category, while keeping the user's need in mind.\n\n\n**Refining the Category**\n\nI've examined the ticket content in detail, focusing on recurring themes. The \"Approval issues\", \"Access issues\", and \"Software/System issues\" are clear. While \"approve purchase requisitions\" is present, the central struggle is around access and approvals, suggesting a workflow block. \"Oracle not displayed\", alongside the \"broken items\" and \"empty displayed\" aspects, solidified \"Access\" as the core category. The emphasis is less on the specific approval itself, and more on the system's ability to facilitate the process.\n\n\n**Clarifying the Root Cause**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's nuances. Although purchase requisitions are mentioned, the core of the problem stems from inability to *access* or *view* items, preventing approvals.  \"Broken items,\" \"empty displayed,\" and \"cannot access\" clearly point to an access-related malfunction. The approval process is blocked due to this underlying access limitation, solidifying \"Access\" as the precise category.\n\n\n"
