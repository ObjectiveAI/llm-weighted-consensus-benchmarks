I'm leaning toward \"Miscellaneous,\" but need to ensure it doesn't fit a more specific category before finalizing my decision.  The problem seems to be an application issue.\n\n\n**Analyzing the Ticket**\n\nI've examined the IT ticket and determined the most suitable category. The \"kudos alerts\" issue appears to be a systemic problem, likely within an application or notification system. Given that the provided categories don't perfectly align, \"Miscellaneous\" emerged as the most fitting, encompassing the general nature of this alert discrepancy.\n\n\n"
