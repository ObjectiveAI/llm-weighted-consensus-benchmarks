I am confident in this classification decision.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Ticket**\n\nI'm now fully committed to the \"Access\" category. The keywords \"add to groups,\" \"add groups,\" and \"add AD groups\" are conclusive. While \"Administrative rights\" was considered, \"Access\" is more broadly applicable to the core action. The \"mailbox\" reference further solidifies this choice. The other categories are clearly irrelevant based on the provided keywords. \"Access\" is the only sensible option.\n\n\n**Solidifying the Classification**\n\nI'm now fully confident in the \"Access\" categorization. The terms \"add to groups,\" \"add groups,\" and \"add AD groups\" definitively point toward access control. Although \"Administrative rights\" was considered, I believe \"Access\" is more broadly applicable to the act of granting group membership. The mention of \"mailbox\" further strengthens this conclusion, as mailboxes are often accessed through group membership. The other categories are clearly not relevant, so \"Access\" is the only sensible choice.\n\n\n"
