I'm carefully weighing this evidence against the possible categories provided to ensure the most accurate classification.\n\n\n**Determining the Core Issue**\n\nI've been analyzing the ticket's text, identifying key phrases such as \"annual leave request,\" \"project managers,\" and \"application,\" which point towards an HR-related issue. The mentions of \"failed,\" \"approval,\" and \"request drafts\" solidify that the ticket revolves around the process of submitting and processing leave requests. Thus, my focus has solidified on \"HR Support\" as the dominant category.\n\n\n"
