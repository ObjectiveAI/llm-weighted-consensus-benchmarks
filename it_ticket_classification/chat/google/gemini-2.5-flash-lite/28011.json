I'm leaning towards \"Purchase\" as the primary focus.\n\n**Classifying Ticket Request**\n\nI'm refining the classification of this ticket, focusing on the core subject matter. The keywords point strongly towards \"Hardware\" given the mention of a \"solid drive\" and its installation, though the purchase aspect is also present. I'm weighing \"Hardware\" as the most encompassing category.\n\n**Finalizing Ticket Categorization**\n\nI've settled on \"Hardware\" as the most accurate category. The description clearly centers on a physical component, the solid drive, encompassing both its purchase and subsequent installation. This choice best reflects the core of the user's request.\n\n"
