My focus is on identifying keywords and context to align it with one of the available IT ticket types.\n\n**Refining the Category**\n\nI'm currently assessing the ticket's content, specifically the mention of a meeting room. This leads me to consider \"Hardware\" as a primary category, assuming the request pertains to IT equipment within that space. If further context suggests otherwise, \"Miscellaneous\" remains a strong fallback.\n\n**Selecting the Category**\n\nI've analyzed the ticket content, and based on the mention of a \"meeting room,\" I'm leaning towards \"Hardware\" as the most fitting category. My reasoning is that meeting rooms typically involve IT equipment that might require checking or maintenance.\n\n**Identifying Ticket Category**\n\nI've been analyzing the ticket's content, and the mention of a \"meeting room\" strongly suggests a focus on IT equipment within that space. My current inclination is to categorize this under \"Hardware\" due to the common association of meeting rooms with AV systems, connectivity, and other IT assets that might require checking or maintenance.\n\n"
