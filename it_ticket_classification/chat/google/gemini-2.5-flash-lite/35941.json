I'm carefully weighing these clues against the available categories to make a precise decision.\n\n\n**Categorizing Router Issue**\n\nI've honed in on the hardware category. The ticket explicitly mentions a \"router\" with \"connection problems,\" and the troubleshooting steps are all hardware-focused (cables, resets). The description rules out HR, access, and storage concerns, pinpointing a failing router.\n\n\n**Identifying Hardware Fault**\n\nI've determined the issue is a hardware fault. The ticket describes a \"router\" experiencing \"connection problems\" and focuses on physical troubleshooting (cables, resets). The troubleshooting steps confirm this: they have switched cables, tried different ports, and attempted a reset. The user mentions that the router is not receiving a signal, further validating the hardware categorization. This is clearly not an HR, access, storage, purchase, or admin rights issue, nor is it related to any internal project.\n\n\n"
