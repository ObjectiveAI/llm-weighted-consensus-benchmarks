It appears to relate to employee departure processes, so I'm leaning toward either \"HR Support\" or \"Access,\" but I need to pinpoint the primary function requested. I'm carefully reviewing the context to determine the best fit before finalizing the categorization.\n\n\n**Analyzing Ticket Content**\n\nI've refined my initial assessment. The provided keywords still anchor me to employee departure. After a deeper dive, the \"HR Support\" label seems most fitting. \"Access\" is also valid due to account deactivation, but \"HR Support\" encapsulates the whole departure process, including the form, date, and notifications which I am now thinking are key. The other categories seem less relevant given the context.\n\n\n**Refining Category Selection**\n\nI'm now fully committed to \"HR Support\" as the primary category for this ticket. While \"Access\" and \"Administrative Rights\" are definitely applicable, they are components within the broader leaver process.  \"HR Support\" encompasses the entire employee departure workflow, which includes the access adjustments. The other options, like \"Storage\" or \"Hardware\", are peripheral to the core issue.\n\n\n"
