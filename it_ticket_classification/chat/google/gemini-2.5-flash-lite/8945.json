                    "reasoning": "**Analyzing Ticket Content**\n\nI'm currently dissecting the ticket description, which involves \"displaying sonar on client network/TV.\" I'm determining which category best fits this request: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" The phrasing is somewhat ambiguous, I'm leaning toward a \"Miscellaneous\" categorization for now.\n\n\n**Evaluating Lightweight Solutions**\n\nI'm now diving deeper into the specifics of the request. The user needs a lightweight way to display \"sonar\" or other items on a TV.  The phrase \"design lead zone\" suggests a project-specific need. While the initial classification of \"Miscellaneous\" still seems plausible, I'm reconsidering whether \"Internal Project\" could be a better fit given the context of a dedicated team or project requiring a display solution, as it involves an internal system on client tv. The lightweight element implies a need to optimize and implement which leads me to a more internal focus.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Project Scope**\n\nThe updated ticket description, which includes \"dear display several items hosted inside organization tv,\" reinforces the internal project categorization. The mention of \"teams got involved\" solidifies this direction.  Focusing on \"lightweight solutions\" and \"implement\" points to an internal development effort and confirms the project-centric approach. The inclusion of the design lead zone points to a single project.\n\n\n**Confirming Project Context**\n\nI'm now fully committed to the \"Internal Project\" classification. The focus on implementation, lightweight solutions, and the internal network context strongly support this. The multiple mentions of displaying specific items (\"sonar\") and the \"design lead zone\" reference underscore the project-specific nature of this request. It's about building a system, not fixing a hardware issue or granting access, and it's not a general helpdesk request.\n\n\n**Refining Category Choice**\n\nI'm now reconsidering the initial leaning toward \"Internal Project.\" While implementation is key, the emphasis on displaying \"sonar\" on a TV suggests a more hardware-centric focus. The request could involve configuring a device to display the content. Now I'm leaning toward \"Hardware,\" as the core issue revolves around getting something to display on a TV screen, although implementation is involved.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Hardware Integration**\n\nNow I'm focusing on the core request: getting \"sonar\" onto a TV display. While the \"Internal Project\" classification seemed right initially, the emphasis on a \"lightweight solution\" to \"implement\" is making me re-evaluate, now leaning towards hardware. The focus is on finding hardware that enables the display. The user needs to *display* content, thus, it seems related to hardware. The solution is dependent on choosing a suitable display setup.\n\n\n**Evaluating Hardware Setup**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on \"Hardware\" as the best fit. I'm focusing on the user's need to display \"sonar\" on a TV. Since they request a \"lightweight solution,\" the request might be about providing or configuring a display device for this purpose. The context implies configuring a device to display content, thus, it leans towards hardware.\n\n**Evaluating Hardware Integration**\n\nI'm now prioritizing the need to display \"sonar\" on a TV, which suggests a hardware-focused solution. The phrase \"lightweight solution implement help\" steers me towards a hardware configuration or setup request. The internal network context could imply a need for a dedicated device to be placed on the network to show the display.\n\n\n**Revising Category to Hardware**\n\nNow, I'm pivoting towards \"Hardware.\" Although implementation is part of the request, the core need is to get content displayed, and providing a suitable display device fits the bill. The lightweight solution and \"implement\" phrases are now seen as a hardware setup task. \n\n\n\n**Evaluating Hardware Setup**\n\nThe ticket seems to revolve around displaying \"sonar\" on a TV. I'm focusing on the implied need for hardware to facilitate this. The call for a \"lightweight solution\" strongly indicates I should be considering the equipment required to achieve the display.\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nI've been working through the ticket, and while \"Hardware\" seems the closest fit, I'm now exploring if the \"Internal Project\" approach, focusing on implementing the display as an internal IT endeavor, might be more accurate. Although there's a need to display Sonar on a TV, could it involve building a solution?\n\n\n"
