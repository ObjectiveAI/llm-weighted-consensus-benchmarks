The description is all about applying for a job and internships. Simple enough, just need to make sure I don't miss anything that'd change the verdict.\n\n\n**Pinpointing HR Alignment**\n\nI'm confident in \"HR Support\" now. The user's application issue, while technical in nature, is *about* applying for jobs and internships. The steps describe the process within the HR application, reinforcing the HR connection. It's a functional problem, but the *function* is an HR process.\n\n\n**Defining the HR Context**\n\nI've solidified my choice as \"HR Support.\" The technical glitch is definitely rooted in the user's attempt to apply for a job. The steps outlined focus on interaction with the application process, not the technical infrastructure itself. While the issue is technical, the request itself is HR related.\n\n\n"
