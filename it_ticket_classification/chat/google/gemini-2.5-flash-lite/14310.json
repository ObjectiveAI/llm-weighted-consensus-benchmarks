After analyzing the provided text, \"make visible only to a certain of people hello informed,\" I'm leaning towards \"Access\" or possibly \"Miscellaneous.\" I need to consider which category is the most fitting.\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nMy focus has shifted to the nuances of the \"Access\" and \"Administrative Rights\" categories. Analyzing the ticket text, phrases like \"make visible only to a certain of people\" and repeated mentions of \"permission\" and \"rights\" solidify the \"Access\" category as the more fitting choice, emphasizing control over visibility and permissions. This is a more direct match for the ticket's core issue.\n\n\n**Narrowing the Focus**\n\nI've been re-evaluating the \"Access\" categorization. After reviewing the text again, the emphasis on permission changes, visibility control (\"make visible only to a certain of people\"), and the frequent use of \"rights\" strongly suggests this as the core issue. I've eliminated \"Administrative rights\" as it's more about system-level permissions, whereas this ticket is about user-level access. I'm now fully confident that \"Access\" is the most precise category.\n\n\n"
