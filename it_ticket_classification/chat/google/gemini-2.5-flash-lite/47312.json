I'm analyzing the ticket's content to ensure an accurate classification.\n\n**Refining IT Ticket Classification**\n\nI've thoroughly reviewed the IT ticket's description, focusing on key phrases like \"accessing document using server\" and \"difficulty getting through.\" Based on this analysis, I've confidently narrowed down the categorization to \"Access\" as it best reflects the user's struggle with resource availability.\n\n**Classifying Ticket**\n\nI've analyzed the IT ticket's details, specifically the phrases \"accessing document using server\" and \"difficulty getting through.\" My current focus is confirming that \"Access\" is indeed the most precise categorization, as it directly addresses the user's inability to reach required resources.\n\n"
