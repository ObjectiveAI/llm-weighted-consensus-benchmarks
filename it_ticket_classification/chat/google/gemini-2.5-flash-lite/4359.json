                    "reasoning": "**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI'm currently focused on the IT ticket categorization. Right now, I'm carefully examining the keywords present in the ticket description, such as \"tasks filters personalize list columns\". This will help me select the most suitable category from the provided list: \"Hardware|HR Support|Access|Miscellaneous|Storage|Purchase|Internal Project|Administrative rights\".\n\n\n**Evaluating Category Options**\n\nI've been meticulously examining the keywords in the ticket. The phrases \"change tool\" and \"add requests columns\" suggest a customization request within a software tool, possibly a ticketing system.  \"Internal Project\" is still a possibility if the change is a project, but it seems more like a configuration change request within an existing tool. I'm leaning toward \"Miscellaneous\" as a catch-all for these feature requests since none of the other options fit precisely.\n\n\n**Pinpointing Ticket's Purpose**\n\nI'm now focusing on pinpointing the ticket's exact purpose, considering phrases like \"personalize list columns\" and \"summary priority.\" I believe the central goal is to enhance a tool's usability through interface customization, not system access or a project. The idea is to adjust existing functionalities. I think the phrases imply configuring an interface or workspace.\n\n**Finalizing Ticket Assignment**\n\nI'm now concluding the analysis.  The request centers on customizing an application's interface. Keywords like \"tasks filters personalize list columns\" and \"add requests columns\" point toward an interface customization within a system for task management.  \"Internal Project\" is still a possibility if this is an internal project to enhance the tool, but I think it's more of a configuration change request within a system, so \"Miscellaneous\" is the best fit. I've eliminated all other categories.\n\n\n**Revising Category Assignment**\n\nI'm now re-evaluating the category. While \"Miscellaneous\" seems like a default, the phrase \"change tool\" suggests a reconfiguration request within an existing application. Adding columns, filters, and priority features implies a customization of the tool's interface, like a ticketing system.  The \"Internal Project\" option remains, but this feels less like a new project and more like a configuration change or enhancement request *within* a system. I'm starting to lean toward \"Miscellaneous\" as the best fit.\n\n\n**Defining the Best Fit**\n\nI'm now carefully re-evaluating the best category. The \"Internal Project\" option is still a consideration if this entails modifying an internal system. The request mentions *changing* the tool, but that could indicate interface customization as well. The request emphasizes *personalizing* existing elements, so the core request isn't to develop a new project. I've eliminated all other options. Now it's a toss-up.\n\n\n**Analyzing Possible Fits**\n\nI'm now carefully examining the options. The request details point to a need for customization within an existing application. The phrasing \"change tool\" suggests an adjustment, and the desire to \"personalize list columns\" and add elements fits a configuration change. While \"Internal Project\" remains a possibility, the focus leans toward modifying the current tool's interface, like a service desk platform.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Request**\n\nI've been evaluating the nature of the request, focusing on terms like \"change tool\" and \"personalize list columns.\" I believe the central idea is an *enhancement* request for a system's interface, like a ticketing or project management tool. I'm leaning toward \"Internal Project\" if this aims to customize an internal system, but \"Miscellaneous\" remains an option, especially if this is a minor configuration change. The goal is clearly about *configuring* the user interface.\n\n\n**Assessing Ticket Intent**\n\nI'm now carefully examining the user's need. The keywords \"change tool,\" and customizing views lead me to consider whether this is a minor configuration or a broader initiative. I feel it's more about improving a tool's interface than beginning a whole project. I'm leaning towards resolving this with \"Miscellaneous\".\n\n\n**Evaluating Ticket's Core**\n\nI've been analyzing the nature of the request, with the focus now on the phrasing \"personalize list columns\" and \"add summary priority\". The central element seems to be about configuring a tool's interface to enhance usability. The phrases imply a workflow modification or configuration.\n\n**Evaluating the Best Fit**\n\nI'm evaluating the nuances of the request and pondering if \"Internal Project\" is the right classification. While it involves system customization, it doesn't appear to be a new project, but a user request to enhance the interface and functionality of an existing tool. The \"change tool\" phrase implies an *existing* system that can be modified, rather than a new project. I'm leaning toward the user request for an existing tool.\n\n\n**Finalizing Category Assessment**\n\nI'm now carefully selecting the best fit. Given the request's emphasis on customizing an application and phrases like \"internal tool,\" \"investigate change,\" and \"personalize,\" I am leaning strongly toward \"Internal Project.\" This is because the request focuses on modifying existing features, which I interpret as an internal enhancement project. The \"Miscellaneous\" category would be a good second choice.\n\n\n**Analyzing the Ticket**\n\nI'm now carefully examining the user's intent. While \"Internal Project\" felt appropriate for modifying an internal tool, the focus on \"personalizing\" indicates this is about fine-tuning an existing system for a specific user, or an *enhancement request*. The \"Internal Project\" implies more substantial changes than indicated by the current request. I'm leaning toward \"Miscellaneous\" as the best fit.\n\n\n**Revisiting Ticket Analysis**\n\nI've been re-analyzing the ticket to refine the category choice. The request aims to enhance an internal system, so I'm now leaning heavily towards \"Internal Project\" to reflect that the user is seeking a configuration or workflow change within an existing application. While \"Miscellaneous\" is a default, \"Internal Project\" captures the essence of improving an internal tool.\n\n\n"
