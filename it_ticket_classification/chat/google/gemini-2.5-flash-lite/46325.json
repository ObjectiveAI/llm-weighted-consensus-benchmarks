The descriptions, specifically \"not working properly,\" \"always requesting password,\" and issues with \"rules,\" point me strongly towards a core technical issue. I'm leaning toward eliminating categories unrelated to technical functionality or access.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Access Issues**\n\nI've refined my initial assessment. The Outlook ticket's symptoms point decisively toward an access-related problem. I've ruled out Hardware, HR, Storage, Purchase, and Internal Project as irrelevant. \"Administrative rights\" is a possibility for password reset scenarios, but I think the core issue here isn't elevated permissions but authentication failure. That leaves \"Miscellaneous,\" which is too broad, and \"Access,\" which perfectly captures the heart of the matter. My strongest instinct is \"Access\" due to the password prompt.\n\n\n"
