Currently, I'm leaning toward the \"Hardware\" category given the focus on a physical device. My next step will be to confirm this classification and ensure no other category applies.\n\n\n**Determining Ticket Type**\n\nI've zeroed in on the \"Hardware\" category. Analyzing the ticket's language, the need for \"mouse replacement\" due to its deteriorated condition and malfunction strongly supports this classification. The attached image further reinforces the need for hardware replacement. The senior developer's role doesn't seem directly relevant to categorization, and the issue's core is the faulty hardware.\n\n\n"
