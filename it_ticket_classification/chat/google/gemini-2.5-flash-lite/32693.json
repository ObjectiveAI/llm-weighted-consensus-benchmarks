The text, \"new starter access card enabling pm re starter form date,\" presents a clear need related to employee onboarding. While it hints at hardware (access card), the primary focus seems to be granting new employee access. Therefore, I'm leaning toward \"Access\" or \"HR Support\" as the most suitable categories. I am working to make this decision to the best of my ability.\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nI've carefully re-evaluated the ticket text, and I've honed in on \"Access\" as the most precise category. While \"HR Support\" was initially a contender, the focus on \"access card,\" \"related accesses,\" and the \"induction period\" strongly suggests a need related to IT permissions. I'm confident that this refinement provides a better and more accurate classification of the ticket.\n\n\n"
