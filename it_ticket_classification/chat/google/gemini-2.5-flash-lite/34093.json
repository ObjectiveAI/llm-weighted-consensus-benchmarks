It's leading me to consider \"Access,\" but I'm leaning toward \"Miscellaneous\" as the best fit. While \"Access\" could be related, the core problem centers on *how* a connection is established, which seems more configuration than pure access denial. The technical nature suggests a system-level hiccup.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Best Fit**\n\nI'm carefully considering whether the root cause is access-related or falls under a more general category. The repeated connection resets and certificate verification issues suggest a broader system-level problem. I'm leaning toward \"Access\" for now, but considering whether \"Miscellaneous\" might be more accurate as it could encompass a wider range of network or configuration issues.\n\n\n**Defining the Core Issue**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on \"Access\" as the most suitable category. The ticket's emphasis on connection failures, certificate verification, and socket issues points towards a problem in establishing access, rather than a hardware malfunction or a specific service request. I am thinking of this issue as a failure to establish a working connection, directly impacting access.\n\n\n"
