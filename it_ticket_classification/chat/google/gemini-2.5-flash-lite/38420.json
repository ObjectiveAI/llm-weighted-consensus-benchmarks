The words \"oracle\" and \"log\" suggest a system or software issue, so I'm leaning toward either \"Hardware\", \"Storage\", or \"Miscellaneous\", but I need to investigate the context further. My next step will be to explore if there is any mention of hardware, storage or any of the other categories. I'm focusing on keywords to best determine the classification.\n\n\n**Prioritizing HR Analysis**\n\nI've examined the ticket text, and the phrases \"annual leave\" and \"logged annual leave\" immediately point toward an HR-related issue. The mention of broken functionality could potentially tie into Access as well, but the core of the problem seems to be an issue with HR data or system access related to leave management. The word \"oracle\" does suggest a possible software issue, but the HR context is much stronger, so my focus is now on determining if Access or HR support is the more appropriate classification.\n\n\n**Clarifying Ticket Focus**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket text and determined the appropriate category. While \"oracle\" initially hinted at possible database or software issues, the phrases \"annual leave\" and \"logged annual leave\" were the deciding factors. The description of broken functionality and inability to delete logged items strongly point towards a problem within the HR leave management system. As a result, my focus has shifted entirely to classifying this as an HR Support ticket rather than any other option.\n\n\n"
