Combining those considerations, I'm leaning toward HR Support, with possible access implications, but those need deeper investigation. My immediate path leads me to the HR Support categorization, however.\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nMy focus remains firmly on HR Support. \"Timecard error,\" \"public holiday,\" and \"interim tax\" all scream payroll and employee records. The \"delete/create\" element, while potentially Access-related, is likely a consequence of the HR issue, not the primary driver. I'm now certain HR Support is the core category here.\n\n\n"
