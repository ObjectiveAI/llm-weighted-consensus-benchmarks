The text's focus seems to be about managing mailbox space (\"archive,\" \"cleaning tools,\" \"receiving mailbox\").  Based on this, \"Storage\" seems the most fitting. I've ruled out others like \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and \"Purchase.\"  The language lacks details required for other categories.\n\n\n**Selecting the Optimal Category**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket text and the available categories. The language is all about managing mailbox content and storage space. I've ruled out Hardware, HR Support, and Purchase. Access could be related but isn't the primary focus. Miscellaneous and Internal Project are too general. Administrative rights also don't fit the context. Storage, however, aligns perfectly with the need to archive and clean up mailboxes. So, Storage remains my top choice.\n\n\n**Focusing on Email Storage**\n\nAfter a deeper dive, I'm leaning heavily toward \"Storage.\"  \"Archive,\" \"mailbox,\" and \"cleaning tools\" are clear indicators.  While \"Access\" is a possibility, the core of the issue is mailbox management, not permission adjustments.  \"Purchase\" and \"HR Support\" are unrelated, and \"Miscellaneous\" is too broad. \"Internal Project\" doesn't seem right either.\n\n\n"
