Phrases like \"access card\" are standing out, leading me toward possibilities like \"Access\" or potentially \"HR Support\". The presence of words like \"work\" and \"tried\" suggest a problem-solving context. Now, I'm analyzing the context of \"hello\" and \"thanks\" to confirm the context.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Ticket Classification**\n\nThe IT ticket text continues to focus my analysis. \"Access card\" remains the central phrase, solidifying \"Access\" as the primary categorization. While a hardware angle is possible, the core issue revolves around gaining access, aligning perfectly with the available options. The phrases \"work\" and \"tried\" support this direct interpretation.\n\n\n**Clarifying the Access Problem**\n\nThe ticket's core issue is now clear: an access card isn't working. \"Access\" is the right primary category. Although \"Hardware\" *could* apply if the card itself is faulty, the central problem is about gaining access. The phrases \"tried\" and \"work\" further solidify this. The context of \"light appear\" supports this too, which may refer to a card reader issue.\n\n\n"
