I'm focusing on identifying the core issue; it seems related to user permissions or access requests. My next step will be to eliminate irrelevant terms and find the most relevant categories in my system.\n\n\n**Defining Access Request Category**\n\nI've homed in on \"Access\" as the core category. The \"preparer role needed\" phrasing across the ticket strongly indicates an access or permission request within the Oracle Procurement system. While \"Purchase\" is related, it's not the primary intent; the request itself isn't a purchase, but access for procurement tasks. I'm excluding categories such as hardware or HR, as they aren't relevant to this specific ticket.\n\n\n**Clarifying the Core Category**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket's language, focusing on phrases like \"preparer role needed\" in \"oracle procurement.\" The emphasis on \"role\" and the system name solidifies \"Access\" as the primary category. While \"Purchase\" is related to procurement, the immediate request concerns authorization. I'm discarding categories like \"Hardware\" and \"HR Support\" because they don't align with granting system-level permissions.\n\n\n"
