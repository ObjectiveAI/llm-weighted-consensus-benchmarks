My thinking is leaning strongly toward \"Storage.\"  The ticket clearly requests an increase in mailbox size, which directly relates to storage capacity. \"Hardware\" doesn't seem appropriate, as it refers to physical devices, and the issue isn't about the hardware itself. The other categories don't seem like good fits at this point, either.\n\n\n**Finalizing Category Selection**\n\nMy focus is now firmly on \"Storage.\" The reasoning is sound: the request explicitly concerns a \"full mailbox\" and a need to increase its size. This directly relates to storage capacity, making \"Storage\" the most suitable category. I have ruled out the other options because they lack the direct relevance to the issue. I am ready to finalize the categorization.\n\n\n"
