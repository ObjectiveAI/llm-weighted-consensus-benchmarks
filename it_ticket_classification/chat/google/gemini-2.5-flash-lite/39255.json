After analyzing the provided description regarding a \"custom artifact\" on a local Maven machine, I'm leaning towards \"Storage,\" although \"Miscellaneous\" is also a possibility if the connection to storage is unclear. It's a tricky one! I'm weighing these two options carefully to ensure accuracy.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Best Fit**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the best category for this ticket. After considering \"Internal Project,\" I've recognized the request's core as installing a custom artifact (the database driver) and managing software dependencies within a development environment. This moves away from administrative rights and storage management. \"Internal Project\" best captures the context, as the artifact is needed for a specific project. This has solidified my choice, although the broader categories were considered.\n\n\n**Refining Category Selection**\n\nI've re-evaluated the ticket's categorization. The initial assumption that \"Internal Project\" was the best fit has been reinforced. While considering access, storage, and administrative rights, the core of the request is about getting a custom artifact (the database driver) to function within the context of a project. The licensing restriction emphasizes the project-specific nature of the dependency. \"Internal Project\" best encompasses this core requirement.\n\n\n"
