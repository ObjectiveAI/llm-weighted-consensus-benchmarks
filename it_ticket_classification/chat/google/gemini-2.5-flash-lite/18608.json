I'm analyzing the provided text to extract keywords that will guide this categorization process.\n\n**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm actively analyzing the provided ticket text to pinpoint the most accurate classification. My current assessment strongly leans towards \"HR Support,\" given the recurring themes of employee absences, time reporting, and personnel record updates. I'm cross-referencing these elements with the other available categories to ensure the best fit.\n\n**Finalizing HR Support Category**\n\nI've confirmed my categorization. The ticket's focus on employee time, absences, and record updates aligns perfectly with \"HR Support.\" I'm ready to proceed with this classification.\n\n"
