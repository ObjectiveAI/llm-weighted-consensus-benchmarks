I've pinpointed relevant keywords, such as \"rename to,\" \"amend owner,\" \"owner switch,\" and \"change,\" to improve the accuracy of classifying tickets, particularly those related to access management. The goal is to route these tickets to the appropriate teams more efficiently.\n\n\n**Determining Best Fit Category**\n\nI've determined that \"Administrative rights\" is the most appropriate category for the IT ticket. The ticket text strongly suggests a request to modify ownership or administrative settings, as indicated by keywords like \"rename to,\" \"amend owner,\" and \"change owner.\" While \"Access\" could be a secondary consideration, the core request revolves around permissions and ownership, which aligns directly with the \"Administrative rights\" category.\n\n\n"
