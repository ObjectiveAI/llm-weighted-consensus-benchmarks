I've analyzed the text, specifically \"new purchase po pm,\" and am leaning toward \"Purchase\" as the primary classification. This term strongly suggests a request related to procurement. I'm exploring if there are any subtle clues that would push me to a different category, but the initial read points strongly toward purchase-related activity.\n\n\n**Revising Category Selection**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket, now considering \"Hardware\" as a strong possibility alongside \"Purchase.\" The mention of a \"dedicated memory module\" is a key indicator of hardware. However, since the user is requesting something in the form of a purchase order it is clearly a procurement process, so I am leaning further toward \"Purchase\" as the primary classification, because this also encompasses the other options. I'll need to remember this for the final decision.\n\n\n**Clarifying Purchase Context**\n\nI'm now fully committed to \"Purchase\" as the correct category. The ticket's repeated references to purchase orders and the general procurement process are undeniable. While the \"dedicated memory module\" points to hardware, the *request* is for the purchase of this hardware, solidifying \"Purchase\" as the primary categorization. The presence of hardware makes it a more complex request, but the key focus is the act of purchasing.\n\n\n"
