It's clearly about a new starter returning from maternity leave and needing assistance with the onboarding process. This strongly suggests the \"HR Support\" category is the best fit, as it directly relates to employee-related administrative tasks.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Best Fit**\n\nI'm revisiting the ticket details, focusing on keywords to refine the category choice. While \"return maternity leave\" is present, the key action is completing a \"starter form\". Considering the available options, HR Support still seems the most appropriate. The user's request is directly about an employee's administrative task associated with onboarding.\n\n\n**Revising Category Choice**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket's core request: filling out a \"starter form.\" The context of \"return maternity leave\" is less prominent. While it hints at HR involvement, the primary action is still form completion. Analyzing the categories, \"HR Support\" remains the best fit. Although access or internal project may involve the request, the primary request falls with HR. I'm focusing on the employee administrative function of form completion.\n\n\n"
