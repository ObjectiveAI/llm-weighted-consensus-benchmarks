My analysis suggests that the ticket likely pertains to access issues, possibly involving problems with document uploads or permissions. The keywords \"attach,\" \"document,\" and \"link\" are pointing me toward that area. I'm exploring whether \"suppliers\" could imply an HR component related to external user access or if it solely indicates access to a storage system. Considering the lack of clearer indicators, \"Access\" seems the most fitting.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Categories**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and narrowed down potential categories for this IT ticket. While \"annual leave\" touches on HR, the core issue centers on suppliers' inability to attach documents, pointing towards an access problem. I'm leaning toward \"Access\" as the primary category, with a secondary consideration for HR context. The keywords and the phrase \"cannot attach\" drive me to the \"Access\" issue.\n\n\n**Confirming Access Issues**\n\nI'm now fully confident that the main issue pertains to access. The text clearly indicates suppliers are facing difficulties attaching documents. While \"annual leave\" is HR-related, the root of this IT ticket lies in suppliers' inability to attach documents, indicating a permission or system access issue. I've ruled out Hardware, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights as they don't directly address the attachment problem. Storage might be a secondary consequence of the access issue (if storage limits exist), but Access remains the core issue.\n\n\n**Determining Primary and Secondary Contexts**\n\nI'm now separating the primary IT issue from its context. The \"cannot attach docs\" part clearly centers on access for suppliers. While \"annual leave\" touches on HR, the core IT problem lies in granting suppliers access to a document attachment system. I'm prioritizing \"Access\" while acknowledging HR as secondary context. I'm focused on the practical \"cannot attach\" issue, which leans towards a permission or configuration problem, not an HR process issue.\n\n\n"
