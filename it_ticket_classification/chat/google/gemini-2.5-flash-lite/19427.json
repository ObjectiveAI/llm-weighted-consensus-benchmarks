So far, \"access\" seems prominent, but I'm considering other possibilities given the context of \"people operations.\" I'm weighing whether \"access\" could relate to HR support, or whether it's solely about system access. The mention of \"assessor\" could also be relevant in final category determination.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Access Category**\n\nI've been focusing on the \"access\" element, as it's the most explicit term in the request. The \"people operations\" context suggests this access relates to HR systems or data. I'm now leaning towards \"Access\" as the primary category, but I'm keeping \"HR Support\" in mind, as it's still a possibility depending on the level of detail within the organization's categorization system. The assessor workflow is also indicative of an access request process.\n\n\n**Finalizing Access Determination**\n\nI'm now fully committed to \"Access\" as the appropriate category. The phrase \"wants to access people operations\" is the core of the request, and maps directly. While \"people operations\" hints at HR, the request is specifically for *access*, not support. \"Access\" encompasses the user's intent more accurately. The \"assessor\" details further support the access request process, solidifying my decision.\n\n\n"
