I'll need to confirm whether any of the information indicates the problems are not the result of either.\n\n\n**Analyzing Access Issues**\n\nI've been analyzing the \"authentication problems\" and \"wired connection difficulties\" described in the IT ticket. I'm leaning toward \"Access\" as the primary category, since the core issue seems to be an authentication failure preventing network access. While \"Hardware\" is a possibility due to the mention of a wired adapter, the symptoms point more directly to access-related problems. I'm focusing on the relationship between authentication and maintaining a stable wired connection.\n\n\n**Determining Primary Issue**\n\nI'm now prioritizing the \"Access\" category, as the primary concern is the inability to authenticate and maintain a wired connection. While \"Hardware\" is a secondary consideration because of the adapter, the core issue is the access failure. I'm focusing on the relationship between authentication and network connectivity problems. The user can obtain an IP address, but the connection is disrupted, which seems like an access issue.\n\n\n"
