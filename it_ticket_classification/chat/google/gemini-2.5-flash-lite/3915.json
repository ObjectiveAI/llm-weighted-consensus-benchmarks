The ticket mentions relocating project team workstations and allocating monitors, leading me to lean toward \"Hardware\" or potentially \"Internal Project,\" though the latter seems less precise. I'm focusing on \"Hardware\" because monitors are tangible equipment.\n\n\n**Revising Categorization Focus**\n\nI'm now focusing on \"Internal Project\" as the primary category for this IT ticket. The \"locomote project team\" aspect reinforces the project-based nature of the request, which is central to assigning monitors and workstation relocation. While \"Hardware\" is relevant, it's a component of the broader project needs. \"Internal Project\" provides a more holistic and precise categorization, capturing both the hardware allocation and the team's project-related activities.\n\n\n**Refining Categorization Decision**\n\nI've decided \"Internal Project\" is the best fit for this IT ticket. The \"locomote project team\" phrase is central. While \"Hardware\" is involved, it is a tool for the project. The \"assign queue\" also reinforces the project's organized approach. Considering all factors, an internal project drives the entire request, so I'm finalizing on \"Internal Project\" as the appropriate category, which encapsulates both hardware allocation and process.\n\n\n"
