After careful consideration of the keywords, \"create forwarder user directly\", I'm leaning towards \"Access\" as the most suitable classification for this request. It seems to pertain to user permissions.\n\n\n**Refining Category Selection**\n\nMy focus has shifted to validating the 'Access' categorization. The core action seems to be user creation for a forwarding role, implying permission management. While 'Administrative Rights' is related, 'Access' feels more targeted to the direct need. I'm exploring if there's any nuance to sway me, but the existing evidence is leaning toward 'Access.'\n\n\n**Revising Categorization Focus**\n\nThe keywords \"create forwarder user\" and \"user redirected phones\" strongly point toward an Access-related issue. My thought process now includes verifying how the call forwarding fits within \"Access\" management. I'm carefully weighing \"Administrative Rights\" again, but the core issue revolves around user setup, pointing back to Access as the best choice.\n\n\n"
