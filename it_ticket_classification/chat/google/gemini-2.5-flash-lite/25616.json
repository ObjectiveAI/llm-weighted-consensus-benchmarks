The text's mention of a \"new starter\" and a \"starter form\" strongly suggests an onboarding-related issue. However, I need to consider the request for assistance with the form, which could also indicate a training or process question. I'm leaning toward \"Onboarding\" with a secondary tag for \"Training/Process\" to cover all bases.\n\n\n**Selecting the Best Fit**\n\nI've re-evaluated the ticket text and the available categories. \"New starter\" and \"starter form\" are the key phrases. While \"Access\" is relevant down the line, the core issue is the initiation of the onboarding process, which heavily involves HR. \"HR Support\" is therefore the most accurate primary category, encompassing the request for assistance with the form and the initial setup.\n\n\n**Finalizing Category Selection**\n\nI've honed in on the HR Support category. The phrases \"new starter\" and \"starter form\" pinpoint the core issue: the onboarding process. This strongly indicates HR involvement. While access is a component, it's a consequence of the HR-driven onboarding, making \"HR Support\" the most accurate primary category choice. I'm confident that this accurately reflects the ticket's primary concern.\n\n\n"
