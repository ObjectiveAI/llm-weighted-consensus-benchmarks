My immediate thought is to map the specific issue to one of the predefined categories. I'm leaning toward \"Access\" as the prime candidate, but I want to be certain the details don't steer me toward another option.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Root Cause**\n\nI've carefully dissected the IT ticket content, meticulously extracting keywords and analyzing their relationships. The phrases \"access problems,\" \"log meetings,\" and \"restrictions\" consistently highlight an access-related issue. Though some details touch on hardware, the core difficulty lies in user authentication and permissions, strongly indicating \"Access\" is the correct category. I'm confident in this classification.\n\n\n"
