Keywords like \"missing time\" and \"maternity leave\" suggest it relates to HR or time tracking, possibly requiring HR Support. However, I need to be more certain.\n\n\n**Defining the Category**\n\nI've been examining the text of the IT ticket in detail. The presence of \"missing time\" and \"maternity leave\" strongly suggests an HR support-related issue.  Phrases about weekly submissions and established processes further solidify this. The text lacks technical jargon and focuses on time-related employee management.\n\n\n**Confirming HR Context**\n\nI'm now fully confident that the ticket falls under \"HR Support\". The recurring focus on time submission, particularly in relation to \"maternity leave\" and the phrasing around established processes, solidly points in this direction. The lack of technical terms further reinforces this categorization.\n\n\n"
