My current process is based on keyword matching, but I'm considering using semantic analysis to improve accuracy. The initial keywords were \"laptop\" and \"rebuild\", pointing towards \"Hardware\". This also takes into account the order of keywords and context. I plan to incorporate stop-word filtering and potentially include a weighting system for the different categories and how relevant words are to them.\n\n\n**Defining Hardware Focus**\n\nI've determined the ticket pertains to hardware issues, specifically with a laptop. Phrases like \"laptop issues rebuild,\" \"laptop stopped working,\" and \"fix problem\" overwhelmingly point toward this category. While \"rebuild\" could hint at software, the primary concern is the faulty laptop itself. My analysis directly links the description's keywords to the \"Hardware\" schema option, ruling out other irrelevant categories like \"HR Support\" or \"Access\".\n\n\n**Finalizing Hardware Diagnosis**\n\nMy analysis is complete and confirms that the ticket falls squarely within the \"Hardware\" category. Key phrases like \"laptop stopped working\" and multiple instances of \"laptop issues rebuild\" firmly establish this. While \"rebuild\" might seem software-related, the context strongly points to a hardware failure requiring repair or reinstallation, not a software issue alone. My decision excludes other irrelevant categories such as \"HR Support\" and \"Access\", solidifying \"Hardware\" as the only relevant option.\n\n\n"
