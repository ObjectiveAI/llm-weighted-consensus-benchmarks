I'm focusing on the technical nature of the request.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Controller Issue**\n\nI've determined that \"Hardware\" is the most accurate category for this ticket. The multiple mentions of \"controller restart,\" \"controller reboot,\" and \"controller\" solidify this. I reviewed all categories, eliminating those unrelated to the technical aspect of the request. \"Hardware\" is the most direct and precise fit, as the issue centers around the maintenance and operation of the controller itself.\n\n\n"
