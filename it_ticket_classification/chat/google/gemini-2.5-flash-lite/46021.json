It's proving tricky; the ticket is brief and somewhat ambiguous. I've considered \"Access\" and \"Miscellaneous,\" but the lack of clear indicators makes a definitive assignment challenging. Further refinement is needed to pinpoint the best fit.\n\n\n**Defining Access Issues**\n\nI've determined the ticket concerns network connectivity or access. Some users can connect, others can't, indicating a selective failure. This points strongly towards an \"Access\" issue. Considering the available categories, \"Access\" is the most precise fit. It captures the core problem of being unable to connect or use a resource.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Problem**\n\nI've determined the ticket concerns network connectivity or resource access. The user's description of some users being able to connect, while others cannot, strongly indicates a selective access failure. This leads me to believe the most fitting category is \"Access,\" which accurately reflects the core problem. I am confident in this classification.\n\n\n"
