It appears the issue is rooted in authentication, specifically login problems due to incorrect credentials or prompts.\n\n\n**Defining the Root Cause**\n\nThe ticket's problem has been precisely identified. People can't log in due to issues with authentication, as suggested by \"incorrect password\" error messages and credential prompts. Even correct credentials don't seem to work. Therefore, the \"Access\" category seems most suitable.\n\n\n"
