My focus is on identifying keywords within the ticket description, like \"error,\" to guide this classification process.\n\n**Resolving Timecard Errors**\n\nI've analyzed the ticket and, based on the references to \"timecards,\" \"submit,\" and \"deleted,\" I'm confident the issue falls under HR Support. The specific mention of an \"error status\" and the proposed solution of resubmission strongly point to a functional problem within the HR or payroll system.\n\n**Classifying Timecard Issues**\n\nI've identified that the core of this ticket concerns errors with timecards and their submission, likely linked to a \"term relocation\" event and an \"oracle\" system. Based on these specifics, I'm categorizing this as \"HR Support\" as it falls squarely within the functional domain of HR and payroll systems.\n\n"
