Terms like \"leaver\" and \"leavers\" point decisively towards the **Access** category. There are other possible categories such as HR support but \"Access\" is more relevant. This initial categorization provides a foundational approach for IT.\n\n\n**Prioritizing HR Support**\n\nCurrently, I'm focusing on the \"HR Support\" category, as it seems most aligned. The ticket references \"leaver forms\" and account deactivation, indicating a process triggered by employee departure, which HR typically manages. I've ruled out \"Access\" as the primary driver is the leaver status. \"HR Support\" captures the context of IT providing assistance with HR-initiated processes.\n\n\n**Revising Categorization Focus**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on \"HR Support\" as the most relevant category. The terms \"leaver forms\" and account deactivation, integral to the ticket, point towards a process initiated by HR related to employee departure. Although \"Access\" could be considered given the account deactivation, \"HR Support\" is the better fit, as IT's involvement stems from the HR-driven leaver status.\n\n\n"
