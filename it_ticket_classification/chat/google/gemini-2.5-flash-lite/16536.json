Initially, \"Access\" and \"Purchase\" seem relevant. I'm focusing on the keywords to reach a definitive classification. The goal is to accurately categorize the IT ticket.\n\n\n**Categorizing IT Requests**\n\nI'm now assessing various IT ticket entries to define their categories. The prevalence of \"purchase po\" within multiple entries strongly leans toward \"Purchase.\" However, several tickets also describe equipment and installation, hinting at a potential overlap with \"Hardware.\" I'm carefully considering how to represent multi-faceted tickets. My focus is still on ensuring accurate classification.\n\n\n**Revisiting Ticket Analysis**\n\nI've been re-evaluating the IT ticket data, focusing on the recurring \"purchase po\" phrase. Although \"enable ad access\" appears in one ticket, the majority revolve around procurement and device installation tied to those purchases. I am increasingly confident that \"Purchase\" is the dominant category, but I am still considering how the \"Access\" element might factor in, given its presence in some of the tickets. The overall focus remains accurate categorization.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Ticket Classification**\n\nHaving reviewed more ticket data, the purchase-related themes, particularly \"purchase po,\" consistently dominate. Though some mention device setup and access (\"enable ad access\"), these requests often follow or are directly linked to the purchase. Considering the user's focus on purchase orders and hardware installations, I'm confident in categorizing these tickets as \"Purchase.\" This choice best captures the core issue, and I believe correctly represents the tickets.\n\n\n"
