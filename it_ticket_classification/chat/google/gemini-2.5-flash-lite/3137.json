I've read the text and am leaning towards \"Hardware\" due to the mention of a \"broken wrist platform.\" The phrases suggest a physical component needing attention. I'll double-check the other options to ensure a better fit doesn't exist, but \"Hardware\" seems most appropriate.\n\n\n**Finalizing the Classification**\n\nI've meticulously reviewed the ticket text again, focusing on the keywords and context. The recurring theme of \"wrist\" support and the mention of \"platform\" solidified my initial \"Hardware\" classification. No other category, such as HR, Access, or Purchase, aligns with the ticket's core issue, which centers on physical equipment. I'm now confident in finalizing the category as \"Hardware\".\n\n\n"
