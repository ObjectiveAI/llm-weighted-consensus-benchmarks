I'm leaning toward either \"Hardware\" or \"Miscellaneous\" but need to refine my assessment to determine the best fit for this particular request.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Issue**\n\nThe analysis points strongly to \"Hardware\" as the most suitable category. The ticket text's repeated references to \"cables\" and their functionality solidify this choice. Although \"Purchase\" could apply if replacement is needed, the root of the problem is the malfunctioning hardware. I've ruled out other categories like \"Miscellaneous\" because \"Hardware\" provides a more precise and relevant classification for this specific issue. The current assessment leans heavily toward prioritizing a hardware-focused solution.\n\n\n**Refining the Classification**\n\nI'm now certain that the ticket falls under \"Hardware.\" The text explicitly states \"cables are not working\" and mentions \"replacing our cables,\" solidifying the hardware focus. Although \"Purchase\" could be relevant if replacement is needed, the root of the problem is the malfunctioning hardware itself. While the wireless mention adds a layer, it doesn't change the core issue. I've eliminated all other categories as unsuitable.\n\n\n"
