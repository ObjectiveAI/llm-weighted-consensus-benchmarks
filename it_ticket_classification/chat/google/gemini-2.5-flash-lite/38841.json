I've re-read the provided text and am weighing several possibilities, considering keywords and phrases. The user's description and the specific errors are really starting to shape my analysis. It's becoming clearer where the issues lie. I'm homing in on the best category for this request.\n\n\n**Analyzing Access Issues**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the ticket text. The core issue centers around password changes and connection errors. Phrases like \"tried to change password\" and \"keep getting errors\" solidify the focus on access-related problems. My analysis points towards \"Access\" as the most suitable category given the provided options. The language suggests an authentication or account access problem, not hardware, HR, or other unrelated areas.\n\n\n**Defining the Category**\n\nI've carefully dissected the ticket text, homing in on the keywords and phrases. The phrases \"change password\" and \"getting errors\" are prominent. The connection attempts after the password change further solidify this. Considering the provided category options, \"Access\" is the most apt choice, given the user's focus on login problems, which is the core issue.\n\n\n"
