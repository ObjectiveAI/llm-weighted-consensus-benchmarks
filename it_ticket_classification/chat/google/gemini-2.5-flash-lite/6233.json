I'm leaning toward \"Purchase\" as the most suitable category, considering the user's request for a new headset. I'll need to confirm that this best encompasses the context.\n\n\n**Determining the Best Fit**\n\nI've been analyzing the text, looking at keywords and context clues. The phrase \"new headset\" is very strong. I've considered \"Hardware\" and \"Purchase,\" and I'm leaning toward \"Hardware\" because the focus is on the item itself, not necessarily the buying *process*. The other categories just don't fit the main issue.\n\n\n**Identifying Relevant Keywords**\n\nI'm currently focusing on the core keywords within the IT ticket. While \"headset\" is the most obvious, I'm also considering context clues that might further refine the appropriate category. Phrases like \"new headset\" and \"grabbed headset\" point towards hardware. The repetition of \"headset\" strengthens its relevance, overshadowing other elements, such as the location mention. I'm focusing on \"Hardware\" because it's directly related to the issue at hand.\n\n\n"
