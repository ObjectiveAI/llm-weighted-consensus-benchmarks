This seems to be the closest fit among the given choices, but I'm checking to make sure it's the most accurate category.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the best option**\n\nI've been going through the options, and I've honed in on \"Access\" as the best fit.  The ticket's phrase, \"add to Friday PM membership\", along with the \"add social\" request, strongly suggest some form of granted access.  I've ruled out the other categories like Hardware, HR, Storage, and Purchases as irrelevant. \"Access\" is looking increasingly like the correct answer as it is the most closely related category.\n\n\n**Finalizing the Categorization**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's phrasing and the available categories. \"Access\" still aligns the most closely with the request, encompassing the need to be added to the Friday PM membership and the \"add social\" requirement. This access may be to a social group, email list, communication channel, or event group. I'm certain that the ticket falls under \"Access,\" after carefully ruling out the other options like storage, hardware, and purchasing.\n\n\n"
