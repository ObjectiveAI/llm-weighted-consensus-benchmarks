My goal is to narrow down the ticket to a suitable categorization for handling.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Hardware Issues**\n\nI've just finished categorizing the IT ticket. After analyzing the ticket, which mentions things like \"computer performance issues\" and \"high processor usage\", I've concluded that \"Hardware\" is the most appropriate category. The ticket describes issues that directly relate to the performance of the machine and its components. \"Miscellaneous\" was a possibility, but \"Hardware\" provides a more precise and actionable classification for addressing the reported problems.\n\n\n"
