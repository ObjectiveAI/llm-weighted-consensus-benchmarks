The text, \"shared mailbox md access issue sent friday shared mailbox access issue dear have added yesterday shared mailbox was,\" presents a challenge. I am leaning towards \"Access\" as the most relevant category given the repeated mention of shared mailbox access issues. I will next evaluate if the text may also relate to \"HR Support\" or \"Administrative rights,\" but so far, \"Access\" feels strongest.\n\n\n**Confirming Access Category**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket text, considering each potential category. The \"Access\" category remains the most fitting. The repeated mention of \"shared mailbox access issue\" solidifies this choice. The inability to receive or send emails, as noted, underscores the access problem. I am confident in assigning \"Access\" as the primary category, with no need for subcategorization.\n\n\n"
