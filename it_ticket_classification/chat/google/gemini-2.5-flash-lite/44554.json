The mention of \"outlook not connected\" strongly suggests a \"Hardware\" or perhaps \"Access\" related issue. I'm weighing these options to ensure the most accurate classification.\n\n**Refining Ticket Classification**\n\nI'm actively refining the categorization of this IT ticket. The recurring themes of \"outlook not connected,\" \"networking issues,\" and \"accessible via wired wireless connection\" strongly point towards \"Access\" as the primary category, with potential overlap with \"Hardware\" if network infrastructure is the root cause. I'm leaning towards \"Access\" for its broader applicability to the user experience described.\n\n**Selecting IT Ticket Category**\n\nI'm finalizing the classification of this IT ticket. The repeated mentions of \"outlook not connected,\" \"networking issues,\" and the workaround involving domain credentials strongly indicate \"Access\" as the most suitable category. I'm confident this captures the core of the user's connectivity and service access problems.\n\n"
