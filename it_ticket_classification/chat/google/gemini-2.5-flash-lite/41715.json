The text provided focuses heavily on \"annual leave\" and \"special leave.\"  Therefore, I'm leaning heavily towards \"HR Support.\" I'm also considering that there could be an \"Access\" issue, depending on how this user handles time off.\n\n\n**Analyzing Leave Details**\n\nI've carefully reviewed the terms used in the ticket text. \"Annual leave,\" \"paternity leave,\" and absence-related details strongly point toward \"HR Support\". The phrase about tracking an incident and providing details further reinforces this conclusion. I feel quite confident in categorizing it this way.\n\n\n"
