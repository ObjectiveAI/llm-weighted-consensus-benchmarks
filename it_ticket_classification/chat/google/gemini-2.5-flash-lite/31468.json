While \"order\" is mentioned, it's tied to facilitating access, not a general purchase request. Therefore, I am leaning toward a categorization that encompasses access control.\n\n\n**Confirming Access Focus**\n\nI'm solidifying my approach: the ticket's language, with \"access cards,\" \"assign teams,\" and \"offices,\" confirms \"Access\" is the prime categorization.  While \"order\" is present, it's a means to access control, not the main issue. The other categories don't align as clearly with the core problems highlighted. The phrases used solidify this decision, and nothing has changed that perspective.\n\n\n"
