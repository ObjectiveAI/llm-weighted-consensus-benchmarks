The text, \"new starter license to be assigned tower friday pm assistants,\" presents a challenge. I am leaning towards \"Access\" but need to consider other categories. A \"license\" suggests a need for system access. I'm carefully weighing this option before a final decision.\n\n\n**Evaluating Category Fit**\n\nMy analysis indicates this ticket is definitively an HR Support issue. The focus on onboarding, credentials, and a new developer all strongly point toward this category. While \"Access\" is relevant due to credential creation, HR Support encompasses the broader context of the new hire process. I'm finalizing the categorization now.\n\n\n**Pinpointing HR Alignment**\n\nMy current assessment solidifies the ticket's classification as \"HR Support.\" The \"new starter\" context is central, encompassing credential creation and license assignment. While \"Access\" is a component, the primary focus is the onboarding process. I'm prioritizing \"HR Support\" to represent the entire scenario accurately and providing the analysis to support this choice.\n\n\n"
