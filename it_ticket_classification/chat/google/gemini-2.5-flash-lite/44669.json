I've re-evaluated the keywords from the ticket description, recognizing \"access\" and \"documents\" as key indicators. I am leaning towards \"Access\" as the primary category, but I still need to consider secondary categories, as it could also fit \"Storage\". I need to be sure that the provided list of categories is the only possible list of categories.\n\n\n**Analyzing Access Issues Further**\n\nI've delved deeper into the ticket description and honed in on the access issue. Although I initially considered \"Storage,\" the user's inability to open documents, coupled with the server address error, solidifies my conclusion. It's an access problem, not a storage capacity one. Therefore, \"Access\" is the most appropriate primary category, as per the available options.\n\n\n"
