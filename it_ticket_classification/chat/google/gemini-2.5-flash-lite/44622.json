Currently, I'm focusing on the \"access\" aspects, given the mention of a \"leaver form,\" map locations and submission problems. These seem to be central.\n\n\n**Categorizing Access Concerns**\n\nI'm now prioritizing the \"Access\" and \"HR Support\" categories. I'm leaning toward \"Access\" because the core issues revolve around accessing the form and its features. The user is experiencing technical difficulties rather than needing HR-specific guidance. I'm focusing on the technical issues with the leaver form, particularly concerning access to the map location and mandatory fields, as the key indicators of the correct category.\n\n\n**Revisiting Category Selection**\n\nMy thinking has shifted slightly. While the initial focus was on \"Access,\" the core of the issue seems systemic and tied to an HR process. The ticket's repeated phrasing and the \"leaver form\" context strongly suggest an HR-related problem, despite the technical nature of the specific errors. Therefore, I'm now leaning more towards \"HR Support\" as the more accurate category. The user needs help submitting an HR-managed form, and the technical glitches are an impediment within that HR process.\n\n\n**Refining Category Selection**\n\nI'm now revisiting the \"Access\" vs. \"HR Support\" categorization again. While the initial instinct was \"Access\" because of technical issues, the core problem does revolve around submitting an HR-related form. The inability to use the map location and bypass mandatory fields are technical barriers *within* an HR workflow. Therefore, \"HR Support\" now seems more accurate, as the underlying issue is the user's need for assistance navigating a problematic HR process. I'm leaning more towards \"HR Support.\"\n\n\n**Focusing on User Impact**\n\nMy focus has shifted. While \"HR Support\" seemed plausible, the user's inability to *use* the form due to technical glitches is the core issue. I'm now leaning heavily toward \"Access\" because the user's inability to submit the form and use the map location, are technical access problems. The systemic issues of the form itself seem less critical than the user's specific access problems. It seems more relevant that the user is encountering a barrier while trying to interact with the system.\n\n\n**Confirming the Access Category**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and the available categories. Despite the form's HR context, the issues are clearly about accessing and using the form, specifically its map feature and mandatory field bypassing. I'm now certain that \"Access\" is the most accurate category. My decision is final.\n\n\n"
