I'm focusing on parsing the input text and identifying keywords to determine the appropriate IT ticket category. I'm considering the potential overlaps and ambiguous phrasing in real-world IT requests. I'm using keyword and contextual clue matching to perform categorization. Currently, I'm working to expand the keyword dictionaries. I'm ensuring the output will be a JSON object as requested.\n\n\n**Identifying Project Focus**\n\nI've refined the categorization logic. The initial keyword-based approach now incorporates contextual analysis. Examining phrases like \"projects not migrated\" and \"old code needs moved\" is crucial. I'm focusing on \"Internal Project\" as the appropriate category given the project migration and code-related keywords. The output will correctly be JSON.\n\n\n**Refining Categorization Criteria**\n\nI've been drilling down on the text. The presence of key phrases like \"projects not migrated\" and \"old code needs moved,\" coupled with the term \"intra,\" reinforces my decision to assign this to \"Internal Project.\" I'm now fine-tuning the keyword matching to accurately capture these project-centric requests, ensuring that the output is in the specified JSON format.\n\n\n"
