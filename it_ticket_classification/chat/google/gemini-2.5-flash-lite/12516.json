My process involves a detailed analysis of keywords and phrases within the provided text. I'm actively using the provided schema (\"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" etc.) as a framework to ensure accurate assignment. I'll continue to evaluate and refine my classification approach.\n\n\n**Identifying Key Ticket Details**\n\nI've been working on extracting the critical details from this ticket text. Specifically, I'm identifying phrases like \"leaver form,\" \"leaving date,\" and \"location,\" which seem to strongly point toward the \"HR Support\" category.  I'm also considering the potential overlap with \"Access,\" given the mention of mailbox and AD rights. I'll refine the categorization logic further as I process more tickets.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Category Relevance**\n\nI'm now focusing on prioritizing the most relevant categories for this specific ticket text. Initial analysis points towards \"HR Support\" and \"Access\" as primary contenders. I'm carefully weighing the significance of keywords like \"leaver,\" \"mailbox,\" and \"AD rights\" in determining the dominant category. Further refinement is needed to resolve potential overlaps.\n\n\n**Assigning Dominant IT Category**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the best single category for this ticket. While \"Access\" and \"Storage\" are pertinent due to mentions of mailboxes and rights, the \"leaver\" context and initial form strongly point towards \"HR Support.\" It involves IT support for an HR-driven process. The keywords are analyzed, and  the \"HR Support\" category encompasses the full ticket context.\n\n\n**Selecting Initial IT Category**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket text and the provided schema. The \"leaver\" context and initial form strongly suggest \"HR Support\" due to the employee's departure. However, the keywords related to mailbox, rights, and AD access indicate a \"Access\" category is also relevant. Further analysis is needed.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Leaver Ticket**\n\nMy analysis indicates the ticket should be categorized as \"HR Support\". The \"leaver\" context is predominant, even with mentions of access, storage, and hardware. While those are relevant, they support an HR-driven process. The keywords and phrases point to IT's role in fulfilling HR's request for an employee's departure.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Primary Category**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and the schema to select the main category for this ticket. While \"Access\" and \"Storage\" are clearly relevant, the dominant theme - the employee's departure - strongly points towards \"HR Support.\" IT's role is to facilitate HR's actions in this \"leaver service\".\n\n\n"
