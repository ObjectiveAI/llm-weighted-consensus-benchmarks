My current hypothesis leans towards \"Access\" due to the explicit request for mailbox configuration, though the hardware aspect of the phone is also noted.\n\n**Identifying Core Need**\n\nI'm synthesizing the provided text, prioritizing the explicit request to \"add shared mailbox.\" While a \"mobile phone\" is mentioned, its context appears to be a tool for the primary access-related task rather than a hardware support issue.\n\n**Configuring Shared Access**\n\nI'm refining my analysis, with a strong focus on the explicit instruction to \"add shared mailbox.\" While a mobile phone is mentioned, its role appears to be instrumental to this primary access-related task, rather than indicating a hardware issue.\n\n**Determining Ticket Classification**\n\nI'm currently synthesizing the provided text, with a strong emphasis on the repeated request to \"add shared mailbox.\" While a mobile phone is mentioned, its context appears to be a tool for facilitating this primary access-related task, rather than indicating a hardware issue itself.\n\n"
