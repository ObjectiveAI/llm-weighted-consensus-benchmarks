The key phrase \"change project manager\" points towards a personnel or project-based issue.  My initial assessment leans towards \"Internal Project,\" but I'm cross-referencing this against other categories.  I'm trying to identify potential keywords that might indicate an alternative.  The focus is to create a robust classification system to avoid mis-categorizing the ticket.\n\n\n**Focusing on Categorization**\n\nI've been drilling down on this ticket. The project manager shift implies an Internal Project, a strong initial assessment. However, the confidentiality aspect and error reporting are forcing me to refine the category choice. I'm hesitant to put the ticket exclusively in \"Internal Project\" and I'm weighing if another more appropriate category exists. My focus is on ensuring comprehensive and correct categorization.\n\n\n**Revising Category Choice**\n\nNow I'm delving deeper into the initial ticket text. The core action seems to revolve around a project manager change. Given this central point, and the nature of internal project management, my revised assessment is to classify the ticket as an \"Internal Project\". I've determined that the context focuses on internal project adjustments and not any other specific category.\n\n\n"
