The text \"new starter pm starter form ext\" strongly suggests a new employee joining. My initial analysis points toward either HR Support or Access, depending on what the \"form\" refers to. It could be related to onboarding or system access provisioning. I need more context to be definitive.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Category**\n\nI'm leaning towards categorizing this as either HR Support or Access. The \"new starter\" and \"starter form\" indicators are clearly onboarding-related. The \"pm\" element is still unclear but could relate to project management or a form's name. Ultimately, the ticket's scope seems tied to employee onboarding, requiring system access and potentially involving HR processes, but I need more clarifying information.\n\n\n**Clarifying Onboarding Context**\n\nI've narrowed down the category to \"HR Support\". The \"new starter\" aspect is the primary driver, strongly suggesting an HR-related onboarding process. While \"Access\" is relevant, I think \"HR Support\" more accurately captures the ticket's initiation. I'm focusing now on confirming that \"pm\" indeed refers to a process related to the \"starter form\". Further analysis might include how the \"ext\" fits, perhaps related to external access setup.\n\n\n"
