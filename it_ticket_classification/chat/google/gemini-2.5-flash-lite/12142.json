My initial thought is leaning towards a category related to access or possibly an administrative function tied to visitor management. I'm carefully considering the implications of \"visitor cards\" and how it might fit within the available categories. My goal is to determine the most precise and relevant classification.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Access Control**\n\nI've determined that the primary focus is access management, specifically activation and deactivation of \"visitor cards.\" The phrases \"deactivate visitor cards\" and \"activate card\" are crucial. This strongly indicates that the task falls squarely under the \"Access\" category, and not \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" or other options. The ticket is about controlling access granted through these cards.\n\n\n**Pinpointing Access Control**\n\nI'm now fully confident that the ticket squarely belongs within the \"Access\" category. The presence of key phrases like \"deactivate visitor cards\" and \"activate card\" solidified this decision. The core function described revolves around managing access permissions through visitor cards, eliminating other possibilities. I've ruled out all other categories, and \"Access\" aligns perfectly with the described actions.\n\n\n"
