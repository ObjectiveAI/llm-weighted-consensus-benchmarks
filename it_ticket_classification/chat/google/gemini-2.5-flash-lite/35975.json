The language used, specifically \"missing time cards\" and mentions of \"Oracle Fusion\", strongly suggests this falls under timekeeping. I'm leaning toward the \"HR Support\" category, as it seems most fitting for this type of issue. The user is having trouble with their time cards in Oracle, and the system is not working as expected.\n\n\n**Confirming HR Categorization**\n\nI've refined my initial assessment. The provided text solidified my initial decision. I'm confident HR Support is the right category. \"Missing time cards\" and the Oracle Fusion reference pinpoint HR timekeeping, more specifically. The issue is about the time card *itself* rather than simple system access. HR Support is the most direct and accurate categorization for this request.\n\n\n"
