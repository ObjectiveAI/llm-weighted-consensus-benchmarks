My current thinking is to analyze the ticket text for keywords and phrases that strongly suggest one of the defined categories. I'm building a system to map these cues to the appropriate 'category' values, ensuring I select the most relevant match. I'm focusing on accuracy and efficiency, as the goal is a robust solution.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Category Relevance**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and determined that \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" are the most likely categories. The ticket mentions access, adding members, and an error message, supporting either choice. The primary focus now is on definitively deciding between these two and refining the category assignment logic to accurately capture similar cases.\n\n\n**Confirming Access Category**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket text and it strongly suggests an \"Access\" category. The keywords \"pas access\", \"add members\", and \"error\" point consistently toward access-related requests. While \"Administrative rights\" is a close contender, \"Access\" seems broader and more fitting, as the request could involve general access permission rather than specifically administrative rights.\n\n\n"
