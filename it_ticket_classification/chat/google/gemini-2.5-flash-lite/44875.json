The user's issue seems related to access restrictions within a specific system or application. I'm weighing options like \"Access\" or perhaps \"Hardware\" if the problem stems from a device malfunction preventing access.\n\n**Refining IT Ticket Categories**\n\nI've analyzed the ticket text and am leaning towards \"Access\" as the primary category. The user explicitly states they \"cannot access location,\" which is the core of their request. While connectivity issues are mentioned, they appear to be a symptom preventing access, not the root cause itself.\n\n**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nI've thoroughly reviewed the ticket's description, and the central theme is clearly the user's inability to access a specific location. While connection issues are mentioned, they appear to be a contributing factor rather than the primary problem. Therefore, I'm confident that \"Access\" is the most accurate categorization.\n\n"
