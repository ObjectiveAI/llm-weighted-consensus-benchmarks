So far, the phrase \"canada protected backup\" keeps jumping out at me, pointing toward a possible storage issue. The simplicity of the rest of the text makes it harder to be more specific. I'm going to re-read the possible choices and see if it makes more sense with more information.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Issue**\n\nThe analysis points strongly to \"Storage.\" The frequency of \"protected backup\" coupled with cost concerns (\"charging backups,\" \"too high too low\") solidifies this categorization. While cost is mentioned, the core request is information about the backup service.  \"Purchase\" or \"Internal Project\" aren't a good fit.\n\n\n**Determining the Best Fit**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's language, zeroing in on \"protected backup\" as the key term. The cost-related phrasing, \"charging backups,\" confirms my initial Storage classification. I've ruled out \"Purchase\" despite the cost mention, as the primary ask is informational. I'm confident in the \"Storage\" assignment.\n\n\n"
