It seems the keywords \"new interns,\" \"bulk starter form,\" \"accounts,\" and \"job\" strongly suggest a match with the \"HR Support\" category.  I'm confident this is the appropriate label.\n\n\n**Determining Best Fit Category**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and evaluating the best-fit category. The phrases \"new interns,\" \"bulk starter form,\" \"accounts,\" \"job titles,\" \"policy,\" and \"testing internship\" keep pointing me toward \"HR Support.\" While \"Access\" is relevant, the overall focus seems broader. \"HR Support\" appears the most comprehensive fit, aligning with the onboarding process for new interns and related administrative tasks.\n\n\n"
