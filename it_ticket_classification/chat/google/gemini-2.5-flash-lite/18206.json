The text mentions a \"new integration with schedule application.\" I need to decide if this falls under Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, or Administrative rights.\n\n**Categorizing New Integrations**\n\nI'm analyzing the provided text to assign the best category for this IT ticket. The mention of a \"new integration with schedule application,\" along with details like \"developed internally,\" \"unix,\" and \"tunneling,\" strongly points towards an \"Internal Project\" classification, rather than more general categories like \"Access\" or \"Miscellaneous.\"\n\n**Finalizing Categorization**\n\nI've concluded that the ticket clearly aligns with the \"Internal Project\" category, given the explicit mention of the application being \"developed internally.\" This, combined with the integration and documentation aspects discussed, makes it the most precise fit among the available options.\n\n"
