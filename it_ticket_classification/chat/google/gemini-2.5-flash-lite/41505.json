This involves carefully analyzing the ticket's description to accurately map it to the correct enum value, ensuring efficient processing.\n\n**Assigning Ticket Categories**\n\nI'm processing the latest IT ticket, focusing on its description to determine the most fitting category from the provided schema. The ticket discusses connection problems, network range limitations, and filter configurations for multiple devices, leaning towards issues related to network infrastructure and access control.\n\n**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm analyzing the provided ticket description, which details connection problems, IP address conflicts, and filter configurations. My current focus is on mapping these issues to the most accurate category within the given schema, strongly considering \"Access\" due to the network connectivity and filter management aspects.\n\n**Resolving Access Issues**\n\nI'm actively working on assigning the correct category to the latest IT ticket. Based on its description detailing connection problems, IP address conflicts, and network filter configurations, I've concluded that the \"Access\" category best encapsulates the core issues presented.\n\n"
