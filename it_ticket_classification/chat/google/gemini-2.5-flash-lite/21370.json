The terms \"working\" and \"facing\" indicate a potential technical issue.  My goal is to effectively place the ticket. Initial analysis suggests the subject is a straightforward problem, and I'm leaning toward a category.\n\n\n**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI've honed in on the ticket's core issue: a malfunctioning \"mentions\" feature, likely stemming from user permission problems. The phrase \"corresponding permission belong corresponding user\" solidified my conclusion. I'm prioritizing \"Access\" now, as it best reflects the root cause related to user rights, based on the recent analysis, and I'm discarding the other categories, as they're irrelevant to the issue described in the text.\n\n\n**Focusing On User Access**\n\nI've revised the ticket's categorization. The analysis of \"mentions\" not functioning, coupled with \"corresponding permission belong corresponding user,\" firmly suggests an access-related issue. My assessment now favors \"Access\" as the most precise category. It directly addresses the core problem: user permission discrepancies, leading to the feature malfunction.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Access Issue**\n\nI've determined that \"Access\" is the best fit. My analysis of the text, particularly the phrase \"corresponding permission belong corresponding user,\" pointed to a user permission problem as the root cause. This directly affects the mentions feature, aligning perfectly with the 'Access' category.\n\n\n"
