The prominent phrase \"connection issues\" strongly suggests it falls under \"Hardware\" or potentially \"Access,\" requiring careful consideration. I'm weighing these options to accurately categorize the issue.\n\n\n**Categorizing Network Issues**\n\nI've refined my thinking by focusing on the core problem: persistent network connectivity issues impacting event setup. The repeated emphasis on the \"switch\" and \"connection cable\" solidified my categorization. While the initial request for the switch hints at a purchase element, the acute problem lies in the malfunction of network hardware preventing successful connections. The recurring annual nature of these issues further points towards a hardware failure or configuration error. I've eliminated \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" and \"Storage\" as irrelevant. \"Purchase\" seems less relevant to the active problem. Thus, my decision is **Hardware**.\n\n\n**Refining Ticket Analysis**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the nuances of the ticket. While a purchase request is involved, the pressing issue is recurring network connectivity failures attributed to faulty or missing hardware: specifically, the \"switch\" and \"connection cable\". The core problem remains the inability to connect, directly linked to this equipment. I'm leaning toward \"Hardware\" as the most accurate classification. I've ruled out others by focusing on this technical root.\n\n\n"
