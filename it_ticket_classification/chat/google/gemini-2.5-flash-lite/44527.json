This points strongly towards an access-related issue rather than hardware or administrative rights.\n\n**Confirming Access Category**\n\nI've thoroughly reviewed the provided ticket fragments, and my analysis strongly indicates an \"Access\" related issue. The repeated emphasis on a \"link\" not \"working\" points directly to a problem with users being able to reach a resource, rather than other potential causes.\n\n"
