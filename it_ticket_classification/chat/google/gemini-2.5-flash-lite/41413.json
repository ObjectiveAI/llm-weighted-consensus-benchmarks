The user can't *raise* a ticket, which points to a fundamental issue with the ticketing system itself.  \"Error loading\" suggests something deeper than the user's specific access, hardware, or other functions, so I'm not leaning towards any of those categories. I'm thinking the best fit is \"Access\" as there is a failure to utilize the system.\n\n\n**Pinpointing System Failure**\n\nI'm now revisiting the \"Access\" category, and I'm finding that it's the more fitting option given that the user lacks the access to properly utilize the system. I was initially thrown off by the phrasing \"error loading,\" but this issue stems from a failure to perform the base function. I am leaning toward \"Access\" being the best fit, with a clarification in the description.\n\n\n**Selecting Primary Category**\n\nI've re-evaluated the issue, and I'm sticking with \"Miscellaneous\" as the primary category. The inability to raise a ticket, combined with the \"error loading\" message, points to a broader system failure in the ticketing platform itself. This isn't related to a specific user's access or hardware, so it aligns best with the broader definition of miscellaneous issues.\n\n\n"
