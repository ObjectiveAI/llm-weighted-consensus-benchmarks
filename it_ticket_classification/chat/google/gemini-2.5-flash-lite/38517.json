The keywords indicate an \"HR Support\" issue, but I need to make sure I don't overlook any subtleties that would suggest another category.\n\n\n**Confirming the Classification**\n\nI've finished the analysis and firmly believe the ticket falls under \"HR Support.\" The language strongly points to leave management, aligning with the \"HR Support\" category.  There were no ambiguities, so it was a straightforward process. I'm now ready to produce the JSON output.\n\n\n"
