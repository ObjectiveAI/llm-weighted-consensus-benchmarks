This suggests the primary problem relates to access, potentially network-related. I need to determine if it is likely an access issue or a hardware issue.\n\n\n**Narrowing down the problem**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and the available categories. The core issue is definitely related to file access, specifically remote access. There's a strong emphasis on errors when trying to open files remotely, especially through a web viewer. While opening files directly works, that's beside the issue. The initial focus narrowed down to \"Access\" as the primary category, seems most appropriate.\n\n\n**Identifying the Root Cause**\n\nI'm now quite certain that the \"Access\" category is the best fit for this ticket. The evidence from the text keeps pointing to this issue. The persistent references to problems with accessing files remotely, especially through the web viewer, solidify this conclusion.  The fact that users can open files directly doesn't negate the core problem. The issue is focused on remote access.\n\n\n"
