The phrases \"fix approval flow\" and \"expenses should be approved by\" strongly suggest a process-oriented issue. Considering the available options, \"HR Support\" seems most relevant. This likely concerns the expense approval process, which falls under HR's purview. I'll need to double check the user's choices, and will confirm the final classification.\n\n\n**Analyzing Relevant Context**\n\nThe ticket's text, especially \"fix approval flow oracle for expenses\" and \"expenses should be approved by left last year manager,\" clearly points towards HR involvement. It's not about hardware, access, storage, purchases, or new projects. While administrative rights are important, this is a procedural breakdown within a specific system, Oracle. I'm focusing on \"HR Support\" as the most appropriate category, given the nature of expense approval processes and the involvement of changing employee roles. I am still analyzing user preference to make sure.\n\n\n**Identifying Core Issue**\n\nI've just finished the analysis, and after a careful review, \"HR Support\" appears to be the most appropriate category. The ticket text's emphasis on \"fix approval flow\" and the outdated manager implies a process issue tied to HR policies regarding expense approvals within the Oracle system. While administrative rights and system access are tangentially related, the central problem revolves around the incorrect workflow after a manager has changed. This is confirmed.\n\n\n"
