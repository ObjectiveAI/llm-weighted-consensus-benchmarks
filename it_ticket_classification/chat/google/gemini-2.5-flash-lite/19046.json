The phrases \"add maps documents,\" \"new location,\" and \"re map guys\" suggest a potential focus. I'm leaning toward \"Storage\" or possibly \"Miscellaneous\" given the ambiguous nature of the request. I'll need further information to make a confident decision.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the ticket text, focusing on the frequent mention of \"map\" and \"maps,\" alongside phrases like \"new location.\" Initially, \"Storage\" seemed appropriate due to document management, but now I'm considering \"Internal Project\" as a strong contender. The repeated requests to \"remap\" and add maps to a new location might indicate a broader project with a storage component. Still deliberating!\n\n\n**Selecting \"Storage\" Category**\n\nCurrently, I'm leaning heavily towards \"Storage.\" The phrases \"add maps documents to new location\" are central, pointing directly towards file management and data organization, aligning perfectly with the Storage category. While \"Internal Project\" was considered, the focus on document location makes Storage the most precise fit.\n\n\n"
