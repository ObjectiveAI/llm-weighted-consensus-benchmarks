My focus is on discerning whether it pertains to hardware, HR, access issues, miscellaneous requests, storage needs, purchase approvals, internal projects, or administrative rights.\n\n**Resolving Ticket Categories**\n\nI'm currently dissecting the core request within the ticket to pinpoint its precise categorization. My analysis is zeroing in on the user's mention of \"deleting grades\" and their concerns regarding the \"survey system's\" behavior and the associated \"stats.\"\n\n**Refining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm currently refining the categorization of the IT ticket. My analysis indicates the issue centers on the survey system's functionality and how it handles data attribution, potentially related to user identity or system logic.\n\n**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm currently analyzing the provided text to assign it to the most appropriate category. My focus is on understanding if the core issue relates to system functionality concerning user identification and data attribution, or a direct request for administrative permissions.\n\n**Identifying Ticket Focus**\n\nI'm continuing my analysis of the IT ticket's core concerns. My current assessment points towards an issue with the survey system's data attribution, specifically how user identities impact recorded outcomes and potentially necessitating data correction.\n\n**Classifying IT Support Requests**\n\nI'm continuing my analysis of the IT ticket's core request, aiming to assign it the most accurate category. My current focus is on discerning whether the user's concerns about data attribution in the survey system, and their subsequent request to delete grades, indicate a need for access adjustments or a broader miscellaneous issue.\n\n**Focusing on Survey System Logic**\n\nI'm continuing to analyze the IT ticket, now focusing on the core issue within the survey system's data attribution and user identification mechanisms, which seems to be the root cause for the requested grade deletion and statistical inaccuracies.\n\n**Focusing on User Attribution**\n\nI'm currently analyzing the core of the IT ticket, which appears to stem from an issue within the survey system's data attribution and user identification mechanisms, leading to the user's request for grade deletion and concerns about statistical inaccuracies.\n\n**Addressing User Identity Issues**\n\nI'm currently refining the categorization of the IT ticket. My analysis suggests the core problem lies with the survey system's user attribution and data recording mechanisms, directly impacting data integrity and necessitating the grade deletion request.\n\n**Categorizing User Attribution Issues**\n\nI'm currently refining my analysis of the IT ticket. My focus is now on the survey system's mechanism for attributing actions to specific users, especially given the mention of being \"logged under name\" and the subsequent impact on data accuracy and the request to delete grades.\n\n**Analyzing User Identity Issues**\n\nI'm currently analyzing the IT ticket, focusing on how the survey system attributes actions to users. My current assessment highlights an issue with user identification within the system, leading to the request to delete grades and concerns about statistical accuracy.\n\n**Categorizing Survey Attribution Issues**\n\nI'm currently analyzing the IT ticket's core concerns, refining my understanding of the problem. My focus is now on how the survey system attributes actions to users, particularly when an incorrect login context (\"logged under name\") leads to unfair statistical outcomes and the need to delete grades.\n\n"
