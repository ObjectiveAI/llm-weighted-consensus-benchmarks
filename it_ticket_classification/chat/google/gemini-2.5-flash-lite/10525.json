I'm leaning towards HR Support or Miscellaneous, depending on the specific context of \"change bellow.\"\n\n**Resolving Ticket Category**\n\nI've finalized the categorization of the IT ticket. Given the details regarding \"error time card,\" submission processes, and weekly reporting, \"HR Support\" is the most fitting classification. It accurately reflects the nature of the issue, which is tied to employee time tracking and HR-related procedures.\n\n"
