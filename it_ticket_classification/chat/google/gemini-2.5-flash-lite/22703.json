I've parsed \"form change\" and \"display alias\" and am considering the context. Is this a system access issue, a data display request, or a general feature modification? The goal is to determine the most fitting category from the specified options. I'm leaning toward either \"Access\" or \"Internal Project\" at the moment, but will need to confirm the scope.\n\n\n**Defining Ticket's Core Purpose**\n\nMy analysis indicates this is a request to alter a system's interface to enhance data visibility. The focus is on a \"form change\" to display aliases alongside project names within the pipeline, with considerations for \"pipeline codes\" and user-friendliness. While not a direct hardware, HR, access, or storage issue, I'm leaning toward either \"Internal Project\" or possibly \"Miscellaneous\" due to its system-focused modification nature.\n\n\n**Categorizing the System Modification**\n\nI've just finished analyzing the ticket's core intent. It's becoming clear that this request is focused on altering an internal system's display of project information. The \"form change\" to show aliases alongside project names strongly suggests an internal system improvement. I'm confident \"Internal Project\" is the best fit, as it aligns with the scope of improving an existing, internal tool or process, like a development pipeline.\n\n\n"
