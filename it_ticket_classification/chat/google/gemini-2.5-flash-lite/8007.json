Based on the clear mentions of \"access for external user\" and the need to \"provide right,\" the most fitting category is undoubtedly Access.\n\n**Refining Category Selection**\n\nI'm continuing to refine the IT ticket categorization. After a thorough review of the text, the core request revolves around granting permissions and access for an external user, making \"Access\" the most precise and fitting classification.\n\n"
