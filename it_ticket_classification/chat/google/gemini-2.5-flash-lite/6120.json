                    "reasoning": "**Analyzing Ticket Content**\n\nI'm currently dissecting the provided ticket text. My focus is on identifying key terms to accurately assign a category. Initial impressions suggest a focus on meeting functionalities or scheduling. I am now looking deeper for hints of related topics.\n\n\n**Determining the Best Fit**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the ticket text and the available categories. The phrase \"add feature\" keeps popping up. This seems to align most closely with either \"Internal Project\" or, if broader, \"Miscellaneous\". I'm still trying to get a clearer picture. My current assessment favors \"Internal Project,\" given the IT context, but further analysis is ongoing to confirm or adjust.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Best Match**\n\nI'm now focusing on the phrase \"add feature\" within the context of possible categories. I'm leaning toward \"Internal Project\" if the request relates to internal system enhancement. I'm also considering \"Miscellaneous\" as a fallback, given the lack of specific context on the system. The multiple \"meeting\" mentions aren't helping. I'm trying to determine whether this \"feature\" is for an existing internal system, or a potential new project. My current analysis suggests that it is better to consider it as an enhancement request than a miscellaneous issue. I'm evaluating the possibility that the ticket wording may be slightly unorganized.\n\n\n**Determining Best Category**\n\nI'm now fully immersed in the ticket's core - \"add feature\". My analysis firmly points toward \"Internal Project\" as the top choice, given the implied software/system enhancement context. The \"meeting\" elements remain perplexing, but I'm focusing on the clearest indicators. \"Miscellaneous\" remains a secondary consideration.\n\n\n**Deciding the Final Category**\n\nI've been going through the analysis and it increasingly leans toward \"Internal Project.\" The request to \"add feature\" strongly suggests a software or system enhancement, fitting the \"Internal Project\" category perfectly. The \"Miscellaneous\" option remains, but feels less precise than the former, and has been consistently de-prioritized. I'm now confident in this decision.\n\n\n**Determining Final Categorization**\n\nMy recent thinking solidified around the phrase \"add feature.\" Considering the context and the available options, I am choosing \"Internal Project.\" This categorization accurately reflects the implied software or system enhancement, suggesting a project that is internal to the company. While \"Miscellaneous\" is a fallback, \"Internal Project\" best captures the nature of the request.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Category Choice**\n\nNow I'm down to two finalists: \"Internal Project\" and \"Miscellaneous.\" The ticket's core, \"add feature,\" continues to point to software enhancement. I'm choosing \"Internal Project\" based on the assumption that even requests for features in external tools often are handled internally as a type of project.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Feature Request**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and the \"add feature\" phrase. The context points toward a potential software enhancement. Considering \"Internal Project\" and \"Miscellaneous\", I am leaning toward \"Internal Project\" as the ticket seems to suggest system enhancement. I feel that \"add feature\" has stronger tie to \"Internal Project.\"\n\n\n\n**Categorizing the Feature Request**\n\nMy analysis shifted to the phrase \"add feature\", leading me to decide between \"Internal Project\" and \"Miscellaneous.\" Given that \"add feature\" strongly implies a system or software enhancement, and \"Internal Project\" encompasses internal development, I'm choosing the former. The intent is to cater to software development requests.\n\n\n**Determining Final Categorization**\n\nMy thoughts have been consolidated around \"add feature\". Considering the system-enhancement implication and available choices, I'm now choosing \"Internal Project\". The request aligns with internal software development efforts. Although it could fit elsewhere, \"Internal Project\" captures the essence of the request.\n\n\n**Analyzing Keyword Associations**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the \"add feature\" phrase. Its IT context strongly leans towards software enhancement. I've re-evaluated \"Internal Project\" and \"Miscellaneous\", but now I am confident that \"Internal Project\" best represents the nature of the request, assuming it involves some form of internal system or application.\n\n\n"
