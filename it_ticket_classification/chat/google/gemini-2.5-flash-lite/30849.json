I'm focusing on the keywords.\n\n\n**Narrowing the Focus**\n\nI've refined my thinking by focusing on the core request: enabling access for a new employee. While initial keywords, like \"workstation,\" could broaden the possibilities, the prominent mention of the \"access card\" leads me directly towards \"Access.\" I'm confident it's the primary IT action.\n\n\n**Reaching a Conclusion**\n\nI've finished the analysis and determined that \"Access\" is the most appropriate category for this IT ticket. The \"new starter access card\" phrase was a clear indicator. While aspects like workstation preparation exist, the core IT action requested is granting access, which aligns directly with the \"Access\" category. The schema's format, using single-word categories, simplified the final decision.\n\n\n"
