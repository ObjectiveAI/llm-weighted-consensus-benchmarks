Based on the keyword \"running again,\" I'm leaning toward a category that reflects resolved hardware problems. My analysis of this ticket suggests that \"Hardware\" is the most fitting category, especially given the context surrounding the keywords I'm currently working with.\n\n\n**Assigning the Primary Category**\n\nI've just finished assigning the primary category. After reviewing the ticket text, considering keywords like \"replacement,\" \"swap,\" and \"engineer,\" and evaluating the available categories, I'm confident that \"Hardware\" is the most appropriate. I've ruled out others like \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and \"Storage,\" as they don't align with the described issue.\n\n\n"
