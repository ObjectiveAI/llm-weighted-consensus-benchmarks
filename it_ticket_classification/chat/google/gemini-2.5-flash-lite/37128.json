It seems like there's an issue with a system's functionality. My initial assessment leans towards \"Access\" or potentially \"Miscellaneous\", as the core complaint seems to revolve around user permissions or the overall system behavior. The lack of clarity makes it tricky, but I'm focusing on the keywords.\n\n\n**Focusing on Category Choice**\n\nI've carefully analyzed the ticket text, considering each word and phrase in the context of the available categories. My thought process is now centered on definitively classifying the ticket as \"HR Support\". The phrase \"annual leave\" clinched it, highlighting the nature of the issue. I'm confident in this classification.\n\n\n**Clarifying the Oracle Context**\n\nI've examined the ticket again, focusing on the \"Oracle\" mention. While it initially seemed like a general technical problem, the recurring theme is \"annual leave.\" I'm now leaning heavily towards \"HR Support.\" The \"Oracle\" might be the underlying HR system, but the core issue clearly centers on leave submission, a distinctly HR function. My decision solidifies around the HR function.\n\n\n"
