The keywords \"connection issues\" and \"employees\" are leading me to consider several potential categories. I'm carefully weighing which category best encompasses the issue, considering the user's need for a precise categorization. Determining the user's need is key.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Category**\n\nI've carefully analyzed the ticket description and concluded that \"Access\" is the most accurate category. The user's inability to access resources due to authentication and wireless connection problems is the central issue. I've ruled out other categories like \"Hardware\" and \"HR Support\" because they don't capture the essence of the problem. Further, the issue is not related to \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" or an \"Internal Project\". Considering the details, \"Access\" is the best fit.\n\n\n"
