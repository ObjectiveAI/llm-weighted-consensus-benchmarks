My current thinking leans towards categorizing this as a software-related issue, though I need to determine the specific category, so will review the provided list.\n\n\n**Revising Category Choice**\n\nI've re-evaluated the categorization. While initially leaning towards \"Miscellaneous,\" I now feel it's an IT support issue, but not clearly defined by any of the existing categories. The problem is definitely with the Confluence application, but it doesn't fall neatly into any of them. \"Miscellaneous\" still seems like the closest fit, but the best approach might be to expand the possible categories.\n\n\n**Defining Final Category**\n\nI've carefully re-examined the ticket's description and the available categories. While none perfectly capture the issue, the overlapping text within Confluence suggests a \"Miscellaneous\" IT problem. It's a technical software issue that doesn't fit the other categories, making \"Miscellaneous\" the best available fit.\n\n\n"
