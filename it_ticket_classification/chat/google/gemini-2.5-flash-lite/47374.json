My approach involves a keyword-based analysis to determine the most relevant category.\n\n\n**Defining Ticket Type**\n\nI've analyzed the text of the IT ticket. The repeated requests for access to \"puma\" and \"fusion\" systems, and the references to \"access sites\" make \"Access\" the most logical categorization. While there were fleeting references to HR matters, the core function of the ticket is getting access. I'm prioritizing the primary request to make the correct category assignment.\n\n\n"
