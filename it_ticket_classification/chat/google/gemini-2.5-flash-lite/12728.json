After analyzing the ticket, I am leaning toward \"Hardware\" since the core issue revolves around faulty RAM replacement. While other categories might be tangentially relevant, the primary action and description strongly point to hardware as the central concern. I am evaluating if any other factors tip the scales towards a different classification.\n\n\n**Narrowing the Focus**\n\nI am now solidly targeting the \"Hardware\" category. Although the upgrade context is relevant, the central problem revolves around the malfunctioning RAM. I've re-evaluated other options, like \"Internal Project,\" but the hardware fault is the core issue, making \"Hardware\" the most appropriate.\n\n\n**Categorizing Hardware Problem**\n\nI am now convinced \"Hardware\" is the correct categorization. The analysis emphasizes the RAM's malfunction as the core issue, despite the upgrade's involvement. My evaluation strongly favors \"Hardware,\" given the centrality of the faulty RAM to the problem. The context of the upgrade is secondary to the fact that the hardware is the failing component.\n\n\n"
