                    "reasoning": "**Determining Ticket Type**\n\nI'm currently trying to assign the correct category to that IT ticket. Based on the sparse text provided, I'm leaning toward \"Access\" because there's a reference to \"add users,\" which strongly suggests access provisioning. However, \"Internal Project\" also seems plausible as it mentions a project name, so the context is not very clear.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Access Provisioning**\n\nI'm now focusing on \"Access\" as the primary categorization for the IT ticket. While the \"project thursday\" reference initially leaned toward \"Internal Project,\" the core action of \"add users\" makes \"Access\" the more direct and fitting category. The rest of the text provides little additional contextual information to suggest any other category, so I'm finalizing my categorization.\n\n\n**Clarifying Ticket Action**\n\nI'm now prioritizing the action of \"add users\". While \"project thursday\" initially pointed towards \"Internal Project,\" the core function is granting access. \"Add users\" feels like the central task. The rest of the text, \"hi please help addresses code thanks software engineer mobile,\" provides negligible categorization context. Thus, I'm leaning heavily towards \"Access\" being the best fit. I'll need to double check the details, since that is all that's given.\n\n\n**Analyzing Ticket Details**\n\nI'm now diving deeper into the nuances of the IT ticket text. While \"add users\" is the most prominent action, I'm carefully considering whether \"Internal Project\" might be a better fit, given the \"project thursday\" reference. The lack of clearer context means I must weigh the possibilities. Although the phrase \"add users\" strongly suggests access, the project context adds complexity. Ultimately, I must choose the best label that matches, to the best of my current knowledge.\n\n\n**Determining Ticket Focus**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the best category for this ticket. The \"add users\" action is central, but the \"project thursday\" mention adds a layer of complexity. If this is *for* a project, then it's a project-related task. The context suggests assigning users *to* a specific project, implying an \"Internal Project\" category is the best fit. I'm focusing on user access related to this internal project.\n\n\n**Refining Ticket Categorization**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the best category: \"Internal Project\". Considering \"project thursday\", the focus isn't simply adding users, but adding users *to* a specific project. This makes \"Internal Project\" a more precise fit. Although \"Access\" is relevant, the project context is key. The user is requesting access that relates to an \"Internal Project\". I am now confident.\n\n\n**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI'm now concluding that the best category is \"Internal Project\". The key phrase \"project thursday\" strongly suggests that the ticket relates to access *within* a specific internal initiative. While \"add users\" is the action, the context of the internal project is critical, making \"Internal Project\" a more precise classification.\n\n\n"
