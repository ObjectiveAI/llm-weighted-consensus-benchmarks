                    "reasoning": "**Refining Category Selection**\n\nOkay, I'm working on pinpointing the ideal category. The text indicates a request to change notification settings based on time zones. This leans towards an \"Administrative rights\" issue, or possibly \"Internal Project,\" depending on the broader context. \"Miscellaneous\" also seems a possibility if the request is very vague. I'm focusing on the implied administrative nature of changing system settings, but need to check for hints of other options first.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Ticket Classification**\n\nI've been analyzing the provided text to categorize the IT ticket. I'm leaning toward \"Administrative rights\" due to the setting adjustments, but also considering \"Internal Project\" given the detailed description of processes and rejections.  The numerous mentions of \"submit cards\" and \"timecards\" adds complexity;  I'm now weighing the \"Administrative rights\" option against a more process-oriented category. The core issue seems related to system configuration and user workflow, suggesting an administrative aspect.\n\n\n**Clarifying Category Focus**\n\nI'm now prioritizing the \"HR Support\" and \"Administrative rights\" options, given the focus on \"timecards,\" rejections, and required corrective actions. There's a strong administrative element implied in needing to adjust system settings and address submission issues. I need to determine if it's strictly a system configuration problem (\"Administrative rights\") or a broader HR support query about the functionality (\"HR Support\"). I'm leaning toward \"Administrative Rights,\" as a configuration change appears necessary.\n\n\n**Narrowing the Best Fit**\n\nMy current focus is on pinpointing the most relevant category. The system seems to involve \"timecards\" and \"approvers,\" which points to either an \"HR Support\" issue or a possible \"Administrative rights\" matter if system configuration is involved. I'm leaning towards \"HR Support\" because the described problems center on the submission process, rejections, and corrective actions, indicating a core issue with the system's function rather than solely administrative privileges.\n\n\n**Revising Category Priorities**\n\nI've been further refining my category selection. While \"Administrative rights\" still holds relevance due to the notification and setting adjustments, the consistent focus on \"timecards,\" rejections, and submissions pushes me towards \"HR Support.\" The system configuration could fall under that category, considering it's related to the workflow and HR process. I'm now leaning heavily toward \"HR Support\" because the described problems seem more related to functionality and user experience than simple access.\n\n\n**Pinpointing Primary Category**\n\nI'm now prioritizing the \"HR Support\" category, given the text describes a user struggling with a system related to timecard submissions, rejections, and approvals. Although adjusting notification settings might involve some admin rights, the core functionality issue lies with the system's process. The consistent mention of \"timecards\", \"approvers\", and \"submission steps\" confirms the strong connection to HR processes.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Category Determination**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and I am now concluding that the issue is primarily HR-related. The core of the problem stems from the timecard submission process, rejections, and required corrective actions. Although there are some administrative elements, the issue points to a functional problem with the timecard system which falls under \"HR Support\". The notification adjustment is a secondary aspect.\n\n\n"
