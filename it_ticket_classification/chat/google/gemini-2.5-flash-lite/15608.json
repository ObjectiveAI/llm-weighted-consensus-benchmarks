After analyzing the text, \"new starter admin wednesday pm re starter form date,\" I'm leaning toward \"HR Support\" or potentially \"Access,\" but I need to make a more definitive decision. I'm carefully considering the implications of \"new starter\" and the potential access needs.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Best Fit**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the ticket text and the available categories. Considering the keywords \"new starter\" and \"starter form,\" I'm now leaning heavily towards \"HR Support.\" While \"Access\" is a possibility, the focus seems to be on the initial onboarding process, which is primarily HR-driven. The \"admin\" aspect seems related to tasks associated with onboarding, solidifying \"HR Support\" as the most suitable category.\n\n\n**Narrowing the Selection**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket text and the available categories again. The phrase \"new starter admin\" points towards administrative tasks *for* a new hire, and the \"starter form\" further solidifies the onboarding process. After a thorough review, \"HR Support\" appears the most precise fit, as the ticket focuses on the initial steps involving the new employee, form-filling, and coordination. I'm now certain about my final selection.\n\n\n"
