After analyzing the text (\"oracle time card for leaving team member\"), I'm leaning toward either \"HR Support\" or \"Access\", but I'm still trying to fine-tune the decision. I'm carefully considering whether this is a direct HR-related issue or an access-related one involving the Oracle system.\n\n\n**Narrowing HR Focus**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket text and it keeps pointing me towards HR Support. While there's a mention of the Oracle system, the core issue is processing a leaving employee's time card, which is an HR responsibility. I'm focusing on the employee's departure and associated administrative tasks. The Oracle system is simply a tool in this HR context.\n\n\n**Reaffirming HR Classification**\n\nI'm now fully confident that \"HR Support\" is the right category. The consistent theme across all the ticket text variations revolves around an exiting employee and their time card. Phrases like \"leaving team member\", \"submitted card\", \"annual leave\" and \"billable\" all point towards HR-specific activities. While the Oracle system is mentioned, it's merely the platform for the core HR process. My analysis has led me to firmly exclude the other categories, particularly Hardware, Access, and Storage, as they have no bearing on this scenario.\n\n\n"
