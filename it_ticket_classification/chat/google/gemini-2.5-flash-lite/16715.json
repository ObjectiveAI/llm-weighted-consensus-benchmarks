The goal is to map these extracted terms to the defined schema categories for an accurate classification. I'm exploring various techniques to refine this mapping process, aiming for high precision in assigning the correct category.\n\n\n**Mapping Keywords to Schema**\n\nMy current thinking centers around the key phrase analysis. I've identified several strong signals within the ticket text. \"New starter form\" and \"vacation requests\" are definitive indicators for \"HR Support.\" Project-related terms like \"add her to project\" point towards \"Internal Project\" or possibly \"Access.\" I'm now evaluating how to handle ambiguous terms, such as those related to software licenses, aiming for accuracy in assignment.\n\n\n**Determining the Primary Category**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and the schema, focusing on the keywords and their implications. Initially, I thought \"Access\" might be a strong contender due to project and license mentions. However, based on the identified keywords and context, I've concluded that the predominant theme is onboarding a new employee. Key phrases like \"new starter form\" and \"vacation requests\" overwhelmingly point to \"HR Support\" as the most appropriate classification, with \"Access\" playing a supporting role in the onboarding process.\n\n\n**Defining the Primary Topic**\n\nI'm now fully immersed in the core content, and I'm homing in on the new employee onboarding. The keywords \"new starter form\" and \"vacation requests\" are definitive indicators of HR involvement, while project and license mentions appear as supporting steps within this process. I've concluded the most fitting category for the ticket is HR Support.\n\n\n"
