The keywords \"add on request\" and \"pull request squash\" strongly suggest \"Internal Project\" as the appropriate classification. I am double-checking for any conflicting information, but the current analysis is leaning heavily towards this category.\n\n\n**Finalizing Categorization Decision**\n\nMy analysis now firmly points to \"Internal Project.\" While keywords like \"installation\" and \"assign\" could touch other categories, \"pull request squash\" and \"add on request\" create the strongest link to development and internal project work. The broader context of software tooling, as suggested by \"marketplace,\" solidified this choice. I am confident in this categorization.\n\n\n**Evaluating Keyword Context**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the specific context suggested by the keywords. The repeated mention of \"pull request squash\" solidifies the software development angle. \"Installation\" and the implied \"improve process\" further cement this categorization. While there's a slight overlap with \"Administrative rights\" or potentially even \"Purchase\" through the \"add on request,\" the core focus seems firmly within internal project work. The software engineering nature is prominent.\n\n\n"
