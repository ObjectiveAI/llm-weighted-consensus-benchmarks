I've re-examined the ticket phrases and categories to strengthen my rationale. The \"cards\" terminology and phrases about submission, status, and rejection strongly suggests \"Access,\" given the system's focus. This decision feels well-supported by the evidence, and I'm confident in my selection.\n\n\n"
