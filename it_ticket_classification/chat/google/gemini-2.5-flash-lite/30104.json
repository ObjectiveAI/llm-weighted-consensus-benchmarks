Based on this, I'm leaning towards the \"Access\" category as the most appropriate fit, as it directly addresses connectivity issues.\n\n**Categorizing Ticket Content**\n\nI'm refining my classification based on the ticket's text. The phrase \"unable to connect to shared folder\" strongly suggests an access-related IT issue. While there are HR-related mentions, the primary technical problem points directly to the \"Access\" category.\n\n"
