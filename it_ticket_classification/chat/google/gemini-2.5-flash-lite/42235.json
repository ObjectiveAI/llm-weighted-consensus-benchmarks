The text \"cannot submit time cards for approval\" is the key. I need to choose the most fitting category from the list: \"Hardware|HR Support|Access|Miscellaneous|Storage|Purchase|Internal Project|Administrative rights\". Based on the user's description, I believe this is an access issue, specifically a problem related to the system access necessary for time card submission.\n\n\n**Focusing on Time Card Submission**\n\nI'm zeroing in on the \"HR Support\" category. The text highlights a time card submission issue. While access could be a factor, the primary concern revolves around the inability to perform an HR-related function. This leans more towards HR processes than general system access issues, so HR Support is the most appropriate.\n\n\n**Re-Evaluating HR Support**\n\nI've re-evaluated \"HR Support\" as the best fit for this categorization task. Initially, the inability to submit time cards appeared as a potential access issue. Now, I see the core problem lies in an HR-related function failing. This aligns perfectly with the \"HR Support\" category, given the nature of time cards and work hours. It's not a hardware, storage, or access rights issue, but a breakdown within an HR system or process.\n\n\n"
