The repeated mention of a \"stolen badge\" strongly suggests an \"Access\" issue. I'm now cross-referencing this with other potential categories, but \"Access\" seems the most fitting. I'll need to confirm if there are any other relevant details that would suggest a different categorization.\n\n\n**Defining the Access Issue**\n\nI'm now certain that the ticket falls under \"Access\". The repeated mention of the stolen badge, along with the implied need to revoke and potentially re-issue access, seals the deal. Although other categories were considered, \"Access\" is clearly the most precise fit. I'm satisfied with this conclusion.\n\n\n"
