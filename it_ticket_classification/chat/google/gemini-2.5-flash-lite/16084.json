The core of the request revolves around granting external clients access to a repository, and I'm weighing \"Access\" against other possibilities.\n\n**Classifying Ticket Request**\n\nI've analyzed the ticket description and confirmed that the core need is indeed related to granting external clients repository access. Therefore, I am classifying this under the \"Access\" category as it best represents the user's requirement.\n\n"
