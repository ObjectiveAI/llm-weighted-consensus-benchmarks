The key terms \"leave request\" and \"annual leave\" strongly suggest an \"HR Support\" category.  I'm also considering the implications of \"requests\" as a broader term, which may necessitate further refinement of the \"HR Support\" definition. I need to ensure a clear distinction between \"HR Support\" and other potential categories.\n\n\n**Narrowing HR Ticket Scope**\n\nI've honed in on \"HR Support\" as the definitive category for this ticket. The phrases \"leave request,\" \"annual leave,\" and the implied approval process clearly point to HR-related tasks. I've considered that the \"requests approved\" suggests a workflow connected to personnel, solidifying my choice of \"HR Support\". The \"manual process\" reference, in particular, further emphasizes the HR link.\n\n\n"
