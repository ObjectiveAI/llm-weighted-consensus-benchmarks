These strongly suggest a storage-related issue, though I need to ensure there are no other relevant aspects I am missing.\n\n\n**Revisiting Ticket Categories**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket's text, and my focus is still on finding the correct IT category. Phrases like \"storage social pictures\" and \"file storage\" are prominent. The repeated mention of \"location\" adds weight to \"storage\" as the best match. I'm double-checking to confirm that other categories, such as \"Access,\" aren't also relevant.\n\n\n"
