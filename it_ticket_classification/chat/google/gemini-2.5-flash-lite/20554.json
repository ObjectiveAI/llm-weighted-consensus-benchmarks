I'm exploring the context further, trying to determine if \"PM\" refers to a system, a person, or something else.\n\n\n**Defining Access Issues**\n\nI've examined the ticket text and it points strongly toward access-related issues. The phrases \"password reset\", \"handles accounts\", and \"report lost card\" are the key indicators. Even the ambiguous \"February PM re expire today\" seems to relate to account expiration, which is an access concern. Given these clear signals, I'm leaning heavily toward \"Access\" as the appropriate category.\n\n\n**Clarifying Ticket Focus**\n\nI'm now fully immersed in the ticket's core problem. \"Password reset,\" \"handles accounts,\" and \"report lost card\" are all pointing toward access control. The \"hub\" mentioned is still unclear, but the overall message is focused on access. Given the \"lost card\" detail, the issue seems to be a multifaceted access incident.\n\n\n"
