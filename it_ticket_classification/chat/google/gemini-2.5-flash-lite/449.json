After analyzing the text regarding \"time cards\" and \"submitting cards,\" I'm leaning toward a specific category, but I still need to ensure the best fit. I'm carefully reviewing the provided list of options. It seems like the solution is becoming clear.\n\n\n**Narrowing Focus: HR Support**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket text concerning time card issues and the provided categories. After examining the options, I'm confident that \"HR Support\" is the most accurate classification. The core issue revolves around submitting, validating, and resubmitting time cards, which are inherently HR functions. While access rights or internal project could be indirectly related, the central problem clearly falls under HR support.\n\n\n"
