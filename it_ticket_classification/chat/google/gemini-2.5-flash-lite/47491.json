I'll need to analyze the specific details to choose the best fit from \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" The vagueness of the initial phrase leaves the actual category still unclear.\n\n\n**Focusing on Access Details**\n\nI've been analyzing the ticket's specifics. While initially appearing vague, the \"problem with computer\" hints at deeper security concerns. \"Access\" is clearly the most relevant category given the description of unauthorized entry and suspicious activity like moving mouse cursors. The context points to a potential security breach, so \"Access\" best captures the nature of the issue.\n\n\n**Confirming the Access Angle**\n\nMy analysis solidifies \"Access\" as the ideal category. The user's description and request pivot directly around unauthorized computer entry. The browser tab changes and erratic cursor movements further amplify the access-related concerns. While other categories might be tangentially involved, \"Access\" directly reflects the core problem. I believe I have now correctly identified the best fit for this particular ticket.\n\n\n"
