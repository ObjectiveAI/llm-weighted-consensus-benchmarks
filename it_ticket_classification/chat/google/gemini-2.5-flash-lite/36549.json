Based on this, I'm leaning towards a category related to timekeeping or possibly HR systems. The ticket doesn't seem to involve hardware, access issues, storage, or general miscellaneous concerns. I'm carefully considering whether this best fits under HR Support.\n\n\n**Revising Category Choice**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket, now considering the \"oracle timecard error\" detail more carefully. My initial inclination towards \"HR Support\" remains, as timecard systems are usually HR-related. However, the mention of \"Oracle\" suggests a potential application-specific issue that could also involve IT. I'm leaning more strongly towards HR Support now as the issue seems to be a timecard status error. It seems most appropriate, as the request is to reset the timecard.\n\n\n"
