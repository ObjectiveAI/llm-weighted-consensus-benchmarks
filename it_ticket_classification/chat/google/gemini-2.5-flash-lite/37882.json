After analyzing the text, which includes phrases like \"annual leave requests\" and references to a line manager, I'm leaning toward a \"HR - Leave Request\" classification. However, I need to ensure there are no subtle cues suggesting it might belong elsewhere, such as a potential issue with the underlying leave system.\n\n\n**Confirming Ticket Category**\n\nI've finished analyzing the ticket content and believe \"HR Support\" is the most accurate category. \"Annual leave requests\" are the main topic, aligning with HR responsibilities. Although \"oracle\" might suggest a system, the core request is related to leave, not system access or a technical hardware issue. This final decision is based on the primary focus of the ticket request.\n\n\n"
