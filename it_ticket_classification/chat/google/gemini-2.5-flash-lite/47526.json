The phrases \"not accessible,\" \"re access,\" and \"unable access\" are recurring. I need to determine the specific resource or system the user can't access, to categorize the ticket accurately. \"Make ticket regarding issue logged for appropriate\" suggests a reporting action; I need to understand what needs to be reported.\n\n\n**Defining the Access Problem**\n\nThe \"access\" theme persists, with \"unable access these reports\" clearly stating the primary challenge. I'm focusing on \"connection secure,\" \"access via explorer,\" \"access different browser,\" and an \"error message\" to pinpoint the access restrictions' specific cause. I'm trying to figure out if it is an issue with the browser, the link or the user's connection. Categorizing it under \"Access\" seems apt, based on the prevalent language.\n\n\n"
