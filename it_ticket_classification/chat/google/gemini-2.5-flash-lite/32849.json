My focus is on understanding the context surrounding employee departures and associated IT actions.\n\n**Processing Leaver Information**\n\nI'm examining the text for indicators related to departing employees (\"leavers\") and their associated IT tasks. The mentions of \"device\" and \"approver\" suggest a need to manage access or system changes for these individuals.\n\n**Reviewing Ticket Classification**\n\nI'm currently reviewing the text, paying close attention to keywords like \"leavers,\" \"device,\" and \"approver.\" My goal is to accurately categorize this IT ticket by understanding the specific actions required for departing employees.\n\n**Analyzing Leaver Data**\n\nI'm now dissecting the text, specifically searching for terms related to employee departures (\"leavers\") and associated IT actions. The mention of \"device\" and \"approver\" suggests the ticket concerns managing accounts or system access for those leaving.\n\n**Classifying Departure Support**\n\nI'm focusing on the text's references to \"leavers,\" \"device,\" and \"approver\" to determine the correct IT ticket category.
