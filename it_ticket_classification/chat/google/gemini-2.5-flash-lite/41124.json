The words \"unable\" and \"approve\" jump out, so I'm honing in on the approval aspect. This clearly points towards a workflow or access-related problem. I'm carefully reviewing the provided categories to ensure I select the most fitting one.\n\n\n**Identifying the Core Problem**\n\nI've examined the ticket content closely and determined the central issue. The user is struggling to approve leave requests, which screams \"HR function.\" Among the provided options, \"HR Support\" emerged as the most precise category. While access issues might play a role, the root cause is inherently tied to the approval process itself. I've ruled out other categories like \"Hardware\" and \"Storage\" because they don't align with the leave request scenario.\n\n\n"
