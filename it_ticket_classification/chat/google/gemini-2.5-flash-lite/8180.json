I'm building a system to identify keywords in the ticket text that connect to specific categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights.  I'm exploring effective methods to precisely link these keywords to the defined categories.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Category Relevance**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and identifying key phrases. Initial focus was on \"file encryption software\" which suggested \"Storage\" or \"Access\". However, \"order\" and \"budget\" clearly point towards a \"Purchase\" category, making it the most relevant. I need to balance specific keyword hits with overall ticket intent to accurately categorize.\n\n\n**Defining Ticket Focus**\n\nI've refined the ticket analysis, leaning heavily on the \"order\" and \"budget\" cues. While \"file encryption\" alludes to Storage and Access, the central need is procurement. The system will categorize this ticket as \"Purchase\", as it is the most direct and accurate.\n\n\n"
