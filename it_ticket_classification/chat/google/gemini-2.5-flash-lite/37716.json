The ticket text's focus on \"timecards\" and their \"approval\" process strongly suggests an administrative or possibly HR-related concern. I need to distinguish between those two possibilities based on the specific context of \"submitted\" and \"rejected\" cards. Considering the possible categories, I'm leaning toward either \"HR Support\" or \"Administrative rights.\"\n\n\n**Finalizing Category Selection**\n\nMy focus is narrowing in on the optimal category. Given the details like timecards, submissions, and approvals, \"HR Support\" appears the most definitive fit. Although administrative rights could be involved in timecard management, it's not the primary focus of the ticket's description. The crux is the process and issues therein, solidly pointing to HR support. My analysis now leans definitively towards that category.\n\n\n"
