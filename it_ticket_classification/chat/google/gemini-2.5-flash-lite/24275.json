The recurring mentions of \"maternity leave\" and associated forms, alongside employee status indicators, strongly point towards an HR Support categorization. The extraneous details seem secondary to this primary HR theme.\n\n**Confirming HR Focus**\n\nI've reviewed the ticket details, and the consistent emphasis on \"maternity leave\" and associated forms, alongside employee status indicators, solidifies its classification as HR Support. The supporting context further reinforces this determination.\n\n"
