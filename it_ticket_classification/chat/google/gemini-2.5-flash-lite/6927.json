I see repeated terms like \"issues\" and references to \"explorer functions.\" The user mentions they updated something, and now specific features aren't working. It appears they are requesting help to re-enable or re-install a computer setting.\n\n\n**Pinpointing Administrative Causes**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the \"Administrative rights\" category. The ticket's symptoms\u2014problems after an update with Explorer functions and needing to check settings/reinstall\u2014point strongly towards potential permission issues. The user's request for help with settings and enabling features suggests a need for escalated access.\n\n\n**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the best category for this ticket. The phrases \"setting explorer enable install computer make these work again\" and \"updated view explorer functions\" strongly suggest a permissions issue. Given the after-update aspect, the \"Administrative rights\" category seems the most precise, even though \"Access\" is also a possibility. The user's request for guidance points towards issues tied to system-level configuration, which I will need to investigate.\n\n\n**Selecting the Optimal Category**\n\nI've determined that the \"Administrative rights\" category best reflects the ticket's core issue. The user's description, especially the phrases \"setting explorer enable install computer\" and \"updated view explorer functions,\" strongly imply that the problems stem from potential permissions or system-level configuration changes. While \"Access\" could be relevant, the focus on fixing Explorer functionality through settings adjustments and potential reinstallation leans heavily towards the need for elevated privileges and broader system configuration management, hence, \"Administrative rights\" is the better fit.\n\n\n"
