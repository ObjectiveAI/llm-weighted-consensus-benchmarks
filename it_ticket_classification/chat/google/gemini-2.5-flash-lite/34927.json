My primary task is to identify the correct category for incoming IT tickets from the predefined enum list.\n\n**Categorizing New Hardware**\n\nMy latest analysis confirms the user is requesting a new mobile phone due to their current device's poor performance. This clearly aligns with the \"Hardware\" category, specifically addressing a device replacement need rather than a general purchase or access issue.\n\n**Classifying Ticket Requests**\n\nI've analyzed the ticket's content, focusing on the user's explicit mention of a \"new mobile phone\" and descriptions of their current device's failure. This strongly points towards a hardware-related issue, specifically a device replacement. Consequently, I've determined that the \"Hardware\" category is the most appropriate classification for this request.\n\n"
