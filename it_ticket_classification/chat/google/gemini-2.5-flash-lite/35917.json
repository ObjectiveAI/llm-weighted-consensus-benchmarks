The timecard language strongly suggests an HR or administrative process. \"Cards\" specifically makes me consider \"HR Support\" with \"Administrative rights\" in second place. I am leaning toward the former due to the explicit request to \"action\" time cards.\n\n\n**Determining Ticket Origin**\n\nI've dismissed the remaining categories, and my analysis strongly favors \"HR Support\". The consistent focus on time card submissions, approvals, and associated statuses firmly anchors this ticket within HR processes. This aligns perfectly with the language used and the user's implicit request for HR assistance.\n\n\n"
