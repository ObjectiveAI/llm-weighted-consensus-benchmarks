The text provided is short and a bit unclear, but the repeated phrase \"increase size\" strongly suggests a storage-related issue.  I'm leaning towards \"Storage\" as the most relevant category based on this key phrase. I'll need to double-check to make sure it's the best fit and that it isn't an overlap with other choices.\n\n\n**Analyzing Storage Issues**\n\nI've examined the ticket text and it's confirmed: the repeated phrase \"increase size,\" alongside the mention of deleting old files, points directly to a storage capacity problem. Given the constraints, \"Storage\" is the definitive category. I've ruled out the other possibilities as they don't capture the core need. This categorization seems quite clear.\n\n\n"
