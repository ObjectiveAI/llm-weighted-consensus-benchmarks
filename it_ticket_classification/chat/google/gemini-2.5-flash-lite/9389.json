The phrase \"potentially fishy delete\" is a strong indicator of a security or access concern rather than a hardware malfunction. My next step is to refine my understanding of how to differentiate between these categories when the phrasing is less direct.\n\n**Identifying Security Concerns**\n\nI'm focusing on phrases like \"potentially fishy delete\" and \"blacklist\" to pinpoint security-related issues. While \"Access\" is a possibility, the stronger indicators lean towards security concerns that aren't directly hardware or administrative.\n\n**Refining Category Assignments**\n\nMy recent focus has been on refining the categorization of tickets, particularly those with ambiguous language. I'm now evaluating the nuances of phrases like \"blacklist\" and \"fishy delete\" to differentiate between potential \"Access\" issues and other security-related concerns, aiming for more precise classification.\n\n**Categorizing Security Input**\n\nMy recent focus has been on refining the classification of tickets with ambiguous phrasing. I'm evaluating how terms like \"blacklist\" and \"fishy delete\" might map to the \"Access\" category, considering it as a form of communication denial, while acknowledging the significant ambiguity.\n\n**Filtering Ambiguous Input**\n\nI'm focusing on phrases like \"potentially fishy delete\" and \"blacklist\" to pinpoint security-related issues.
