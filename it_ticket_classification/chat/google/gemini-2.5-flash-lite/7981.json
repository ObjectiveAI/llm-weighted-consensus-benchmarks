My current focus is on incorporating keyword analysis with a more sophisticated approach. I am investigating using a rule-based system for the initial categorization, followed by a machine learning model for fine-tuning. This should improve accuracy and handling of ambiguous requests. The allowed categories guide this process.\n\n\n**Re-evaluating Category Options**\n\nMy analysis indicates the ticket content strongly points towards a purchasing-related task. The terms \"contracts\", \"approvals\", and \"million contracts\" suggest a process requiring authorization before proceeding, aligning well with the \"Purchase\" category. While an internal project is a possibility, the specific language leans more towards immediate action related to contract approval and execution, which is more directly tied to procurement.\n\n\n**Determining the Best Fit**\n\nI've determined that \"Purchase\" is the most accurate category for the ticket. The keywords \"contracts,\" \"approvals,\" and the scale implied by \"million contracts\" all strongly suggest a purchasing or procurement-related task. The context suggests these contracts require authorization for execution. This further reinforces \"Purchase\" over other potential categories like \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous,\" which are less precise. The analysis focuses on aligning keywords to given category.\n\n\n"
