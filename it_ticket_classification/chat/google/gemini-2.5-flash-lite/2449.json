My immediate focus is mapping this to one of the established classifications like Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, or Administrative rights.\n\n**Resolving Access Issues**\n\nMy current focus is on the ticket's core issue, which strongly suggests a need for \"Access\" support due to terms like \"connect remotely\" and \"tunnel to tunnel.\" The performance aspect hints at network configuration challenges related to remote connectivity.\n\n**Confirming Category Assignment**\n\nMy thoughts have solidified on \"Access\" as the most appropriate category for this ticket. The keywords \"connect remotely\" and \"tunnel to tunnel,\" along with the mention of necessary configurations, strongly align with the need for support in establishing or optimizing remote connectivity.\n\n"
