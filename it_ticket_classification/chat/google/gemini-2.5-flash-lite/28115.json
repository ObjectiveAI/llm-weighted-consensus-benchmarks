The key phrases \"additional floor expansion\", \"obtain quote hardware\", and \"hardware\" strongly suggest a hardware-related issue, leaning towards \"Hardware\" as the most suitable category. However, I am still considering other possible matches, namely \"Purchase\", but \"Hardware\" seems the best fit.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Ticket Components**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the IT ticket text. My latest focus is on the recurring phrase \"additional floor expansion,\" which strongly suggests project planning. The equipment and resource allocation mentions further support this. Considering this, \"Internal Project\" emerges as a more relevant category than \"Hardware,\" which initially seemed plausible. My decision is now to classify this ticket as \"Internal Project\".\n\n\n**Categorizing Project Tickets**\n\nCurrently, I'm analyzing the ticket text, considering that this request requires categorizing an internal project. It now seems clear this is an \"Internal Project\" due to the significant expansion. Though \"Purchase\" and \"Hardware\" fit, the project scope and planning involved outweigh the specifics of individual purchases or equipment.\n\n\n"
