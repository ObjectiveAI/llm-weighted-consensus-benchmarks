I'm leaning toward \"HR Support\" due to this word, but other terms seem ambiguous or irrelevant. More analysis is needed to determine the correct category.\n\n\n**Analyzing Ticket Text**\n\nI've been analyzing the \"leaver card\" ticket, and I'm leaning heavily towards \"HR Support.\" \"Access\" is also relevant, of course, as terminating access is part of the leaver process. But the phrase \"leaver card\" itself suggests that the primary issue is related to the overall HR procedure, rather than just the technical aspects of access control. I need to make a final call, but I'm thinking I'll select \"HR Support\".\n\n\n**Revising Category Choice**\n\nNow I'm focusing on the final call. After reviewing the ticket text, \"leaver card,\" and analyzing the potential categories, I've concluded that \"HR Support\" is the most accurate. While \"Access\" is relevant, the phrasing \"leaver card\" suggests a broader process initiation managed by HR, which includes access modifications. I feel confident that my selection is justified based on the analysis.\n\n\n"
