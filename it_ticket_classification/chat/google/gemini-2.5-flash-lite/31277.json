While the wording is somewhat unclear, \"remove...member...modification...she left\" strongly suggests an access-related issue. This points towards the \"Access\" category, though \"HR Support\" could also be applicable. I need to weigh the options.\n\n\n**Prioritizing HR and Access**\n\nI'm now focusing on the core issue: the departing team member. While access removal is implied, the trigger is the HR event. The ticket's phrasing, \"she left\", cements this. I've ruled out Hardware, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Miscellaneous is too broad. HR Support feels more fitting than Access, even though access modification is the action. My output will reflect this reasoning in the JSON format.\n\n\n"
