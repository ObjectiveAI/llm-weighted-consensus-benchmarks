I am trying to determine the correct IT category. Based on the words \"extension cord\" and \"relocation\", I'm leaning toward hardware or a relocation-related purchase. However, the ticket's unclear nature makes it challenging.\n\n\n**Narrowing the Focus**\n\nI've refined my thinking by focusing on the core request: an extension cord, prompted by a relocation. The user's query leans strongly towards a hardware need, potentially linked to setup in a new location. \"Purchase\" remains a possibility if the company always *purchases* such items, but \"Hardware\" seems a more straightforward match.\n\n\n**Clarifying the Core Need**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket, focusing on the keywords \"extension cord\" and \"relocation\". The mention of \"provided by\" shifts the emphasis away from an explicit purchase. I'm now leaning heavily toward \"Hardware\" as the most suitable category. The ticket describes a request for a physical IT item needed for a relocation setup, solidifying my choice.\n\n\n"
