I'm considering \"Access\" as the primary category, given the phrase \"cannot access.\" The additional information seems related to the need for capability or functionality, but the core issue appears to be access. I'll need to remember to consider how these tickets relate to each other.\n\n\n**Narrowing Ticket Classification**\n\nOkay, I've dived deeper into the ticket's language, identifying the core access problem with the phrase \"cannot access\". The \"instance\" and \"build capability\" details feel secondary to the access issue, so I'm firming up my leaning towards \"Access\" as the prime category. Considering how these elements interact, I'm refining the definition.\n\n\n**Clarifying Ticket Focus**\n\nI'm now fully immersed in the IT ticket, and the \"cannot access\" phrase is leading me to the \"Access\" category. The \"instance\" and \"build capability\" details feel secondary to the core access need. I'm focusing on the request to resolve this \"access\" problem.\n\n\n"
