The \"mailbox full\" issue keeps surfacing, alongside mentions of an \"archiving option\" and the server. I'm leaning toward a category that encompasses both storage and email-related issues. I'm comparing the fit of each available option, carefully.\n\n\n**Confirming the Scope**\n\nI've examined the ticket text. It clearly centers on email storage management, with terms like \"mailbox full,\" \"archiving,\" and \"server synchronization\" appearing. I'm confident \"Storage\" is the best fit, given the focus on capacity and data retention. My analysis now points firmly in this direction.\n\n\n"
