After carefully reviewing the details, I think it's likely related to HR Support. The mention of an \"annual leave request\" and \"awaiting approval status\" seem directly linked to HR processes. I'm hesitant about \"fixing issue\", but given the main content, I think \"HR Support\" is the most likely category.\n\n\n**Reaching a Conclusion**\n\nI have carefully assessed the ticket's contents and have decided on \"HR Support\". The phrase \"annual leave request\" and mention of \"approval status\" indicate an HR-related system or workflow. Despite the \"fixing issue\" language, the core request is tied to HR processes.\n\n\n"
