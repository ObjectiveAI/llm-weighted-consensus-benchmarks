The phrase \"submit your time cards for approval\" suggests a connection to administrative tasks.  I am thinking this likely falls under the Administrative Rights category.\n\n\n**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI've closely examined the ticket content, and the repeated emphasis on time cards and approvals strongly points towards \"Administrative Rights.\" The various error messages and corrective actions also align with administrative processes. I'm now fairly confident in this categorization.\n\n\n**Identifying Ticket's Core Issue**\n\nI've carefully analyzed the ticket content, and the focus is clearly on \"time cards,\" submission, and approval processes. This points towards an HR-related issue. The system errors and required corrective actions reinforce this connection.\n\nI'm now confidently leaning towards \"HR Support\" as the most suitable category. The ticket describes a user-facing issue within a standard HR process.\n\n\n"
