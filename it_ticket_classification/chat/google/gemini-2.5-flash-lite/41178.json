The \"rejected expense report approval\" aspect leans strongly toward HR processes or perhaps even Finance. I'm carefully considering the scope of \"HR Support\" to ensure it encompasses this situation effectively. My goal is to apply the most precise label possible, avoiding overgeneralization.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Root Cause**\n\nI've been drilling down on the root of this expense report issue. The attachment problem appears secondary to the core rejection. My analysis points toward a procedural or HR-related glitch, rather than a purely technical one. I'm leaning toward \"HR Support\" as the most accurate category, as the attachment issue seems incidental to the core rejection process.\n\n\n**Identifying the Primary Category**\n\nI'm now fully immersed in the details of this ticket. The expense report issue, coupled with the attachment problems, screams \"HR Support\". I'm meticulously confirming that \"HR Support\" comprehensively addresses both the rejection and the technical snags, ensuring the most accurate and useful category is applied.\n\n\n"
