After analyzing the text, I'm leaning towards \"Hardware\" or \"Access\", as the user seems to need a physical connection for a monitor. However, it's not entirely clear yet. The context hints at a need for hardware, but could this be about permissions or access? I need to analyze it further to select the most appropriate category.\n\n\n**Refining the Classification**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket details, focusing on keywords like \"cable\" and \"connect monitor.\" The user's request is undoubtedly hardware-related; the core need is physical connection. After a deeper analysis, I've eliminated \"Miscellaneous\" as a possible choice, even though some ambiguity exists. Considering the given categories, \"Hardware\" is the most precise and accurate classification for this specific IT request.\n\n\n"
