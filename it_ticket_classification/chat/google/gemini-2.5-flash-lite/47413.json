After analyzing the provided content, which discusses password resets and access, I'm leaning toward selecting the \"Access\" category. The focus appears to be on regaining or modifying access to a system. I'm double-checking the other options to ensure this is the best fit.\n\n\n**Finalizing the Classification**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's content, focusing on the repeated \"reset password\" requests and the implications for user access. While \"Internal Project\" felt tempting due to \"automation tests,\" the core issue is regaining access. After a thorough review, I'm confident that \"Access\" is the most accurate category. It directly addresses the user's need to restore access via password reset.\n\n\n**Determining the Best Fit**\n\nI've been analyzing the ticket's text, especially the recurring \"reset password\" requests. The \"automation tests\" bit gave me pause, but after careful review, I believe the core issue is user access. Initially, I considered \"Internal Project,\" but the consistent focus on password resets solidified my choice of \"Access\". It directly addresses the user's need to regain system access.\n\n\n"
