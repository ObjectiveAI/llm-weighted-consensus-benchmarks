After careful consideration of the text \"new interns for bulk am friday july re bulk starter form interns hi\", I am leaning towards \"HR Support\". The phrase \"new interns\" suggests a potential human resources-related issue, and I think that it is the best fit.\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nMy focus has shifted to the nuances of the \"HR Support\" category.  While \"Access\" might be relevant down the line, the core issue is the new intern onboarding process.  I believe the phrase \"bulk starter form\" points directly towards an HR-centric function. Therefore, assigning this to HR, the most sensible classification, is my next step.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI have carefully reviewed the ticket text again. The phrases \"bulk starter form\" and \"interns starting july\" are central. IT support for HR regarding intern onboarding is the most appropriate categorization. Though access might be required, the primary concern is the starting documentation, and that places this firmly within \"HR Support\". I'm moving forward with this classification.\n\n\n"
