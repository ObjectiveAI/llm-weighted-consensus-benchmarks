So far, the phrase \"raise cr\" is a primary indicator. I am also searching for the schema, with specific phrases and terms that can point towards the various categories.\n\n\n**Defining Internal Project Scope**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on classifying the ticket, leaning toward \"Internal Project.\" The \"raise cr\" indicates a Change Request, and the proposed changes to the survey system align well. My focus is on refining the description to reflect the ticket's core intent. I want to improve my accuracy.\n\n\n**Refining Category Selection**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on confirming \"Internal Project\" as the best fit. My analysis of the ticket text, with an emphasis on \"raise cr\" and the proposed solution, confirms this category. I've ruled out other categories, and it seems the strongest contender. Next, I need to finalize the rationale.\n\n\n"
