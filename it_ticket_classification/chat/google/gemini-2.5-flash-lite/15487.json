The description is a bit repetitive, but the key phrase \"internal audit procedure\" is standing out. I'm leaning towards \"Internal\" as the most appropriate category, given the context. I'm now weighing this against the other options to ensure the best fit.\n\n\n**Analyzing Category Fit**\n\nI've been re-evaluating the \"Internal Project\" category, considering the shared \"internal audit procedure\" as a task within a larger project. I am also considering \"Access\" as a possibility. But, the core action remains \"sharing,\" which seems more aligned with a project context. Considering the repetition in the ticket, the focus is on the *procedure* itself, not access to it. Therefore, \"Internal Project\" still feels like the most accurate choice, given the context.\n\n\n**Revisiting Category Choice**\n\nNow I'm revisiting the initial decision, ensuring \"Internal Project\" still holds up as the best category. The \"share\" action still seems most aligned with a task within a project context. While \"Access\" is a possibility, the verb \"share\" implies something broader than simply granting permissions. I am leaning toward Internal Project because sharing a procedure, regardless of the system, still points to a task inside a larger, possibly ongoing, internal project.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Ticket**\n\nI'm now fully committed to the \"Internal Project\" categorization. The repetition in the ticket made me double-check my initial assessment, but it reinforced the core action: sharing a procedure within the company. The phrase \"internal audit procedure\" is still the key. While access might be implied, the core request to share the procedure puts it firmly within an internal project context.\n\n\n"
