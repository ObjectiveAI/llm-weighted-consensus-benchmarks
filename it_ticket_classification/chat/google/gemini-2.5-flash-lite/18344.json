The \"leaver process,\" \"accounts closed,\" and \"access\" keywords are heavily influencing my decision. I'm leaning heavily towards \"Access\" but want to confirm this is the best fit, ensuring there isn't a better choice.\n\n\n**Solidifying the Conclusion**\n\nI've just concluded that \"Access\" is the most accurate category. After carefully considering each option in light of the ticket's keywords\u2014\"leaver process,\" \"accounts closed,\" and \"access denied\"\u2014it became clear that the core issue is managing user account permissions, which fits squarely within the scope of access control. I've ruled out other categories like \"HR Support\" and \"Administrative rights\" as less direct, and eliminated unrelated categories.\n\n\n"
