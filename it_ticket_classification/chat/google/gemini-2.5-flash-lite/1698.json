Given the terms \"new starter\" and \"internship program accepted job offer,\" I've narrowed it down significantly. It appears the request relates to onboarding. My analysis leans towards \"HR Support,\" but I'm checking if access or administrative permissions are mentioned further in the ticket.\n\n\n**Revising Category Choice**\n\nNow, I'm refining my assessment. The inclusion of \"developer\" and \"change his credentials\" clarifies that this involves setting up a new employee's access. While \"HR Support\" remains relevant for the overall onboarding process, \"Access\" is becoming more critical due to the focus on credentialing. The permanent status change further solidifies the need for account provisioning. While HR may be involved, the core issue seems to be granting system access, leaning my thoughts to the \"Access\" category.\n\n\n"
