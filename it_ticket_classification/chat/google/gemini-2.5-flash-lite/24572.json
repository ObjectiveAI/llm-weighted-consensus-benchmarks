The phrase \"maternity leave\" appears repeatedly, along with hints about an inactive account, guiding my analysis. Considering the options provided, I'm leaning toward selecting the most relevant categorization.\n\n\n**Analyzing Ticket Content**\n\nI've honed in on the HR Support category for this ticket. The phrases \"maternity leave\" and \"her inactive\" were key indicators. The mention of \"developer senior technician active\" further strengthened this connection, as it likely relates to user status changes related to an employee on leave. I'm now certain \"HR Support\" is the most appropriate categorization.\n\n\n"
