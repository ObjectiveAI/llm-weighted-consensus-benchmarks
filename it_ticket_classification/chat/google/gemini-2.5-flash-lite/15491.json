I'm building a system to accurately map these keywords to the available categories: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" The goal is to develop a reliable method for automated ticket categorization, which, hopefully, I will begin implementing soon.\n\n\n**Assigning Purchase Category**\n\nMy analysis of the ticket text, \"new purchase po thursday purchase po dear purchased pro retina intel kb please log allocation please take consideration mandatory receipts section order receive item ordered received two po perform partial how video thank best regards compliance,\" points firmly to a \"Purchase\" category. The frequent mentions of \"purchase,\" \"order,\" \"po,\" and \"received\" solidify this conclusion, despite the presence of hardware like a \"pro retina intel kb.\" No other category aligns as well with the dominant theme of acquiring items.\n\n\n**Analyzing Ticket Text**\n\nI've carefully dissected the ticket text, meticulously examining keywords. While \"pro retina intel kb\" suggests hardware, the core request revolves around purchasing. Keywords like \"purchase,\" \"order,\" \"received,\" and \"po\" point definitively to the \"Purchase\" category, and no other category aligns as well. It's clear this is not about hardware *troubleshooting* but about acquiring new items.\n\n\n"
