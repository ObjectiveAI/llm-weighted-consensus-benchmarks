My initial thought is to weigh up between HR Support or Access as the best fit, but I'm open to other possibilities. The word \"joiner\" makes me want to think about onboarding. I'm focusing on the relationship of the ticket text to the available categories.\n\n\n**Narrowing the Options**\n\nI'm now carefully examining the nuances of \"Access\" versus \"HR Support\". While access might be a consequence of the task, the central focus appears to be the broader onboarding process, strongly aligning with HR Support's functions. I am considering which category best encompasses the *entire* range of actions described, and the HR Support bucket is looking more likely.\n\n\n**Finalizing the Analysis**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket text and the available categories. \"HR Support\" emerged as the clear winner. The language revolves around new and rejoining employees, starter and transfer forms, and administrative officer involvement. These point directly to HR-related onboarding processes, making it the most accurate choice, even though some aspects may touch on access.\n\n\n"
