Based on the words \"time cards\" and \"approval\", I'm leaning toward either \"HR Support\" or potentially \"Internal Project\", but further analysis is necessary to be sure. My main focus is accurately matching keywords to the given schema categories.\n\n\n**Narrowing Category Scope**\n\nI'm now narrowing the category scope.  While \"Access\" remains a possibility, the focus leans toward \"HR Support\" or \"Administrative Rights.\" The Oracle time card context strengthens the case for \"HR Support\" as the primary need. It's about guidance on time card approval within an HR process, though administrative permissions could be a secondary concern.\n\n\n**Pinpointing Primary Issue**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the primary issue. After careful review, the core request revolves around \"bulk approval\" within the Oracle time card system. It feels most aligned with \"HR Support\". The user seems to seek guidance on the *process* of time card approvals within their HR workflow, even if administrative permissions are involved.\n\n\n**Revising Category Choice**\n\nI'm now revising my category choice. While I initially leaned towards \"HR Support,\" further analysis suggests \"Administrative Rights\" might be more accurate. The focus on \"bulk approval\" within the Oracle time card system points to a specific permission-related issue.  The user's need to find a \"way\" to approve suggests a lack of necessary system capabilities.\n\n\n**Defining Primary Category**\n\nI've determined \"HR Support\" appears the most relevant. The user seeks a method for time card bulk approval. This aligns more with process guidance, a core HR function. While administrative rights are a possibility, the request prioritizes the *how* of the process, a natural query for HR support.\n\n**Determining the Best Fit**\n\nI've carefully considered the best category. Analyzing the user's request, I believe \"HR Support\" is the most fitting. They seek guidance on a process (bulk time card approval), an HR function, rather than permission. While \"Administrative Rights\" is potentially involved, the core issue is an HR workflow.\n\n\n"
