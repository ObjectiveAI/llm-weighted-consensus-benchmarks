Initial attempts to identify hardware or access issues proved fruitless. My focus shifted to HR Support, given the leave-related content, but I'm now leaning heavily towards a \"Miscellaneous\" categorization due to the lack of a perfect fit within the options and the software context. This appears to be a bug report, rather than a general request.\n\n\n**Narrowing the HR Focus**\n\nI've refined my initial HR Support assessment. While the Oracle system is relevant, the core problem centers on the *process* of submitting annual leave, specifically the user interface and functionality within that system. This points strongly towards a system-related bug or a UI issue within an HR context, solidifying my choice.\n\n\n**Revisiting Category Selection**\n\nMy thinking has evolved. I've re-examined the ticket's language, especially keywords like \"buttons\" and \"displayed.\" While HR Support remains relevant due to the annual leave context, the focus isn't simply on HR *advice*. It's about a *problem* within the Oracle system interface related to the leave submission process, making a \"Miscellaneous\" categorization more precise. The user mentions specific visual elements, signaling a potential bug in the user experience of submitting leave. I'm now leaning toward the view of this as a software-specific issue with HR implications.\n\n\n"
