My primary task is to assign it one of the predefined categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, or Administrative rights, based on the ticket's content.\n\n**Determining Ticket Classification**\n\nI'm processing the IT ticket to determine its most fitting category. Given the content revolves around report structure, data extraction, and modifications, I'm leaning towards \"Internal Project\" as the most suitable classification, though I'm still evaluating if \"Miscellaneous\" might be a better fit if it's a more general request.\n\n**Selecting Ticket Category**\n\nI've analyzed the IT ticket's content, focusing on terms like \"report structure,\" \"add column,\" and \"extract information.\" Considering the available categories, the request for modifying report details doesn't align with Hardware, HR, Access, Storage, Purchase, or Administrative rights. While it could support an Internal Project, the request is directly about report alteration, making \"Miscellaneous\" the most fitting classification.\n\n"
