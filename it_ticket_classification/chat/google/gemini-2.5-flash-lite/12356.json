The repeated references to a \"desktop machine,\" \"workstation,\" and the mention of \"costs\" and \"replace\" strongly suggest the primary category is \"Hardware,\" with a secondary consideration for \"Purchase\" due to the replacement aspect.\n\n**Categorizing IT Tickets**\n\nI'm currently reviewing the provided text to determine the most accurate IT ticket category. Keywords like \"desktop machine,\" \"workstation,\" and mentions of \"special hardware software requirements\" strongly suggest \"Hardware\" as the primary category. The context also hints at a \"Purchase\" due to the discussion of \"costs\" and the need to \"replace\" an allocated machine.\n\n**Analyzing Ticket Details**\n\nMy focus is on extracting the core issue from the text. The repeated references to a \"desktop machine,\" \"workstation,\" and the discussions around \"costs\" and \"replace\" strongly indicate that \"Hardware\" is the main category, with \"Purchase\" as a likely secondary classification.\n\n**Focusing on Purchase Justification**\n\nI'm refining my analysis to prioritize the \"Purchase\" category. The explicit mentions of \"costs\" and the directive to \"replace allocated\" strongly suggest that the primary concern is acquiring new hardware, even with the underlying hardware specifications.\n\n**Prioritizing Acquisition Needs**\n\nI'm currently refining my analysis to focus on the \"Purchase\" category. The explicit mentions of \"costs\" and the directive to \"replace allocated\" strongly suggest that the primary concern is acquiring new hardware, even with the underlying hardware specifications.\n\n**Acquiring New Equipment**\n\nI'm now focusing on the procurement aspect. The explicit mentions of \"costs\" and the directive to \"replace allocated\" strongly suggest that the primary concern is acquiring new hardware, even with the underlying hardware specifications.\n\n"
