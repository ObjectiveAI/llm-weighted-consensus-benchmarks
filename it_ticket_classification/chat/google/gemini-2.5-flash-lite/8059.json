My focus is on identifying keywords and context to ensure accurate classification.\n\n**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm currently evaluating the new starter ticket. Given the context of onboarding and potential setup needs, I'm leaning towards classifying it under \"HR Support\" or \"Access,\" as these best encompass the likely requirements for a new employee.\n\n**Classifying New Starter Request**\n\nI'm currently refining the classification for the \"new starter\" ticket. My analysis suggests \"Access\" is the most fitting category, as onboarding typically involves provisioning system permissions and accounts, aligning well with the core function of IT support in this scenario.\n\n**Refining Ticket Categorization**\n\nI'm continuing to refine the categorization of the \"new starter\" ticket, weighing \"HR Support\" against \"Access.\" The phrase \"help fill\" combined with \"new starter\" strongly suggests the need for account provisioning and system access setup, making \"Access\" my current primary classification.\n\n**Assigning IT Ticket Category**\n\nI'm currently analyzing the content of the \"new starter\" ticket to assign the most appropriate category. My assessment prioritizes the core IT functions related to onboarding, such as account provisioning and system access, leading me to favor \"Access\" as the primary classification.\n\n**Assigning Ticket Category**\n\nI'm currently evaluating the incoming ticket from a new starter.
