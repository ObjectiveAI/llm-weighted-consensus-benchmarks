I'm building a logic-based approach to narrow down the possibilities.\n\n\n**Defining the Ticket Context**\n\nI've analyzed the ticket text: \"new starter,\" \"starter form,\" \"joining,\" and \"administration officer.\" These terms strongly suggest an onboarding process, pointing towards \"HR Support.\" I'm confident in classifying the ticket under this category. The textual evidence clearly indicates an HR-related issue.\n\n\n**Determining Category Selection**\n\nI've meticulously analyzed the ticket text, extracting key phrases like \"new starter\" and \"starter form.\" The textual evidence consistently points towards an onboarding process, suggesting \"HR Support\" as the most suitable category. I'm now confident in finalizing the ticket's categorization. The phrase \"administration officer\" also supports this classification.\n\n\n"
