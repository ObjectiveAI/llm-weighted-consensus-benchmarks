The keywords \"leaver\" and \"ad forwarder\" are consistently appearing. It's leaning towards an \"Access\" issue, given the implication of user account management and data forwarding upon departure.\n\n\n**Analyzing HR Involvement**\n\nI've been circling back to the \"HR Support\" category.  Initially, \"Access\" seemed dominant. However, the consistent \"leaver\" focus now highlights the substantial HR coordination in this scenario.  It's likely HR will be involved in many of these tasks. The question now is whether the ticket is specifically about HR initiating the process, or about the technical actions themselves.\n\n\n**Defining Final Category Focus**\n\nI'm now fully committed to the \"HR Support\" category. While the initial focus on \"Access\" was understandable due to the technical nature of mailbox, AD, and profile changes, the consistent \"leaver\" context and the implicit HR initiation make this the best fit. I've considered that the request originates from the HR department managing the employee's departure. This confirms \"HR Support\" as the most appropriate categorization.\n\n\n**Determining Ticket Origin**\n\nI'm now fully confident that the ticket's primary category is \"HR Support.\" The consistent keyword \"leaver\" clearly points to an employee offboarding scenario, a core function of HR. While the associated technical tasks, like mailbox and AD management, are certainly related to \"Access,\" the central impetus for these tasks originates from HR's management of the employee's departure. This is supported by the phrase \"tickets automatically logged\". Furthermore, the involvement of a \"purchase coordinator\" suggests HR coordination with other departments.\n\n\n"
