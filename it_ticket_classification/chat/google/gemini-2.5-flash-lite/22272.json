I need to make a final decision, then provide the category.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Best Fit**\n\nI've carefully analyzed the ticket description focusing on phrases like \"line management change\" and \"old has left needs\". Initially, I leaned toward \"HR Support,\" and my analysis confirms this is the best fit. While \"Access\" is a possibility due to potential user access adjustments, the core of the request concerns employee status updates, firmly placing it under \"HR Support.\"\n\n\n"
