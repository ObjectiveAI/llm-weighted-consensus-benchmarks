My current focus is on mapping this to the most appropriate classification, weighing the nuances of \"Internal Project\" against the core problem of unexecuted automation.\n\n**Classifying Automated Task Failures**\n\nI'm currently refining the classification of IT tickets, with a recent focus on issues related to automated processes and scripts failing to initiate. My current thought process is weighing whether these automation anomalies best fit under \"Internal Project\" due to potential project-specific environments, or if a more general classification is warranted given the core problem of unexecuted scheduled tasks.\n\n**Refining Classification Logic**\n\nI'm currently analyzing the ticket's core issue, which revolves around scheduled scripts and automated processes failing to execute.
