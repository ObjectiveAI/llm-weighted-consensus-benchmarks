It appears related to a return from maternity leave. I'm leaning toward \"Access\" as the primary category, but I need to ensure it's the best fit compared to the other options.\n\n\n**Assessing the Core Issue**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket's text, focusing on the \"access card\" and \"pass badge\" phrases. The maternity leave context seems secondary; the central issue is the card's non-functionality. I considered \"HR Support\" but decided the IT's role is troubleshooting the *technical* access problem. \"Access\" is the most precise category. I'm now certain this falls squarely within the \"Access\" domain.\n\n\n**Determining the Root Cause**\n\nI've examined the ticket text again. The core problem is the *non-functionality* of the access card or pass badge. I considered the context of maternity leave, but it's secondary to the direct access problem. The \"Access\" category directly reflects the technical issue at hand. My choice of \"Access\" aligns with the specific IT support request for troubleshooting the card's non-functionality.\n\n\n"
