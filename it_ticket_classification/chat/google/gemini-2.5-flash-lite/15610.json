The \"maternity leave\" topic doesn't seem to fit the technical categories, but \"update tuesday\" hints at an administrative task, and \"assets\" could be hardware or storage-related. I'm focusing on finding the best fit from the options provided.\n\n\n**Prioritizing HR and Assets**\n\nI'm now focusing on \"HR Support\" as the main category, strongly considering it due to the prominent mentions of \"maternity leave\" and \"annual leave.\" Managing the employee's assets, particularly the \"monitor,\" is also a key factor. \"Hardware\" might be a secondary consideration given the \"monitor\" but the main thrust of the ticket clearly leans towards the HR process. I'm finalizing my category choice with this in mind.\n\n\n**Evaluating HR as Primary**\n\nI'm now fully committed to the \"HR Support\" classification. Analyzing the \"maternity leave,\" \"annual leave,\" and the necessity of managing the employee's \"assets\" during their time off, I believe the ticket is primarily a request for support related to these HR-driven processes, even though a hardware asset (\"monitor\") is involved.\n\n\n"
