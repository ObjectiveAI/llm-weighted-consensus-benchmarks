My focus is on achieving an accurate and specific categorization.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Category**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket details and the provided category options. The user's description points directly to \"Access\" issues, related to problems with joining and utilizing meeting resources. I've ruled out the other categories as they don't seem to fit the problem. I'm satisfied with this classification.\n\n\n"
