The phrasing \"new starter\" and \"joiners\" seems to lean towards an onboarding process. While \"access\" or \"administrative rights\" are possibilities, I'm leaning toward HR Support, which includes onboarding-related requests. I'm focusing on the implied request and how to classify it with certainty.\n\n\n**Analyzing the Onboarding Request**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and am leaning towards \"HR Support\" for the ticket classification. The core issue seems to involve onboarding new staff members, focusing on setting up accounts and providing access, which aligns closely with HR's responsibilities. While \"Access\" is a possibility, the context strongly suggests a broader onboarding workflow.\n\n\n**Determining the Primary Request**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the text again, and \"HR Support\" continues to be the most accurate primary category. While \"Access\" is certainly relevant, the core essence of the request revolves around the onboarding of new employees, a task predominantly handled by HR. The ticket text's inherent connection to new hires strongly suggests that the central request is directly related to HR activities.\n\n\n**Prioritizing the Onboarding Request**\n\nI'm now prioritizing the need for \"HR Support\" for this ticket. While \"Access\" could be a secondary category, I feel the overarching context clearly places this within the HR realm. The inherent new-starter nature of the request implies a request that HR initiates.\n\n\n**Classifying the Onboarding Ticket**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on \"HR Support\" as the primary category, with \"Access\" a strong secondary consideration. While \"Access\" is crucial, the ticket's core is the onboarding process stemming from HR's activities, not a singular request for access. It is  about supporting the setup needed for new hires, which aligns with HR functions.\n\n\n**Classifying Onboarding Request**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's text, especially \"new starter\" and \"joiners\", and concluded that \"HR Support\" best fits the primary category. While \"Access\" is relevant, the core request revolves around the broader onboarding process, which is primarily managed by HR. This encompasses all IT actions required due to the HR-driven new starter process.\n\n\n"
