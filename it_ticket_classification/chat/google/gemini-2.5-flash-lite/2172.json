Phrases like \"manage access shared\" point directly to the \"Access\" category. I am still evaluating other patterns, but so far I have found enough information to identify the likely category.\n\n\n**Narrowing Ticket Classification**\n\nRight now, I'm focusing on \"Access\" as the primary category for this ticket. The phrases within the ticket description are strongly indicating an access management issue. I've noted a slight consideration for \"Administrative rights\", but \"Access\" is looking more relevant due to the specific focus on permissions and control.\n\n\n"
