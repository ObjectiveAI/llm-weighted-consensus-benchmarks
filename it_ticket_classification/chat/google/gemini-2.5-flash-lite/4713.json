So far, the phrase \"assign assign myself\" is the closest I have to a clue. Could be an \"Access\" issue, though it's still quite a stretch. I am continuing to try.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI'm now focusing on the \"change of cc\" phrase.  I've reasoned that in an IT setting, this might involve adjusting email distribution lists or similar communication channels. While \"Access\" could be relevant, the ticket's vagueness makes it a gamble. The \"assign assign myself\" piece is still a bit of a mystery, but leaning toward it implying the task of modifying access lists.  I'm weighing how best to classify it.\n\n\n**Clarifying the Core Action**\n\nI've been re-evaluating the \"change of cc\" phrase. I now understand that this request could involve updating distribution lists or communication settings. I'm hesitant to put this ticket into \"Access\", since modifying a CC list doesn't strictly relate to granting or revoking system privileges. My current view is that it's more like a request to modify a communication process rather than pure access rights. \"Miscellaneous\" appears increasingly appropriate, as the request is simply for a change.\n\n\n"
