It seems the keywords point towards a potential purchase or a change related to procurement systems. I'm leaning toward \"Purchase\" or \"Internal Project,\" given the reference to \"catalog\" and \"ordering.\" I am still analyzing if this is HR related because no keywords point to that.\n\n\n**Narrowing Ticket Classification**\n\nMy assessment narrows the ticket down to \"Purchase.\" The keywords consistently point to procurement-related actions. Specifically, \"purchase requests,\" \"ordering cards,\" and the \"catalog\" references reinforce this direction. While some phrases hint at workflow issues, the core issue is clearly initiating a purchase or modifying the purchasing process itself. I am now confident in this assignment.\n\n\n**Pinpointing Ticket Type**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket details, focusing on \"change catalog,\" \"purchase requests,\" and \"ordering cards.\"  These phrases strongly point toward a purchase-related action. Although there's a routing issue, the primary focus is on the procurement itself. I'm now certain \"Purchase\" is the accurate classification.\n\n\n"
