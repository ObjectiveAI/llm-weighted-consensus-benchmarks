The description \"issue and timecards sent thursday re notification update time\" presents a bit of a challenge. While it mentions timecards, which *could* relate to HR or internal systems, the core issue seems to be related to notification updates. It's difficult to confidently assign it to a category. I will continue to think this through.\n\n\n**Defining HR Support Tickets**\n\nI am now delving into the ticket descriptions more deeply. The recurring themes of \"timecards,\" \"hours,\" \"annual leave,\" and \"line manager\" strongly point toward HR-related support. Moreover, issues with the system's functionality, like filling timecards or updating profiles, further strengthen this categorization. I've ruled out \"Hardware,\" \"Access,\" and \"Storage\" as irrelevant. Now I am leaning toward HR support.\n\n\n**Clarifying the Core Issue**\n\nI've been analyzing the ticket descriptions, and it's becoming clearer that the primary concern revolves around HR-related functions. The mentions of \"timecards,\" \"leave,\" \"line manager,\" and system malfunctions concerning these aspects strongly indicate an HR support issue. The common theme is trouble completing standard HR tasks. I've ruled out other categories like \"Hardware\" and \"Storage\" due to irrelevance, and now I'm certain that the issues are related to HR.\n\n\n"
