The text mentions \"oracle problem\" and an error message, which suggests a technical issue. I've narrowed it down to potential categories like \"Access,\" \"Storage,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" The wording of the error itself will be the deciding factor. I'm focusing on the nature of the error to classify it more accurately.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Best Fit**\n\nI've been reviewing the ticket text: \"oracle problem sent friday december problem dear please help with below error when try submit get below error thank your for your help regards.\" I've ruled out \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" \"Storage\" doesn't seem to apply, either. Although it involves Oracle, it's not simply an access problem, so I'm leaning toward \"Miscellaneous,\" but I'm open to further refinement. I'm focusing on the functional nature of the \"error when trying to submit\" to finalize my choice.\n\n\n**Refining Category Selection**\n\nI'm now fully confident that \"Miscellaneous\" is the best fit. Analyzing the text, it's clear the issue stems from an \"oracle problem\" and an \"error when try submit\". While Oracle is mentioned, the core problem is functional, not access-related or storage-related. \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights\" are also definitely not applicable. It's a general software issue that doesn't neatly fit other predefined categories, justifying the \"Miscellaneous\" designation.\n\n\n"
