Examining the text, I've identified keywords like \"extra disks,\" \"external hardware,\" and \"disks.\" Based on this, I'm leaning toward the \"Storage\" category as the most accurate fit. I'm cross-referencing this against other potential categories, but \"Storage\" seems the strongest contender.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Best Fit**\n\nI'm now focusing on differentiating between potential categories. While \"Hardware\" and \"Storage\" are still viable, the emphasis on acquiring new disks for file storage makes \"Purchase\" stand out. The ticket's primary action is procurement, which is more directly aligned with the \"Purchase\" category than simply the storage aspect. However, I am still checking to ensure \"Purchase\" is the ideal choice.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Procurement Action**\n\nI've refined my thinking by focusing on the core *action* the user needs. While \"Hardware\" and \"Storage\" are relevant, the emphasis on \"procure\" and \"order\" clearly points to \"Purchase\" as the most suitable category. The ticket's primary goal is acquiring more disks, making \"Purchase\" the most direct fit.\n\n\n**Refining Categorization Decision**\n\nI've determined that \"Purchase\" is the best fit. While \"Hardware\" and \"Storage\" are relevant, the emphasis on \"procure disks\" and \"order disks\" made \"Purchase\" the most direct category. The user's primary goal is to acquire, not manage existing storage or troubleshoot hardware. The text highlights a need for more disks, prompting the *action* of procurement. This contrasts with scenarios where \"Storage\" or \"Hardware\" might be better, where the focus is managing or troubleshooting. The intent is clear: to get more disks, and that means purchasing them.\n\n\n"
