The phrase \"laptop was working expected\" also points to this, as the current state is not \"expected.\" Thus, I lean toward the \"Hardware\" category.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Root**\n\nOkay, I've honed in on the hardware angle. The ticket details, like the screen error and memory issue, are just too compelling. I'm feeling confident about \"Hardware\" being the right category, based on this fresh analysis.\n\n\n"
