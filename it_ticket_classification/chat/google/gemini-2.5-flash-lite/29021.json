                    "reasoning": "**Assessing the Ticket**\n\nI'm currently dissecting the ticket description to pinpoint the right category. \"Disable leaver cards Friday PM card card\" suggests an access-related issue, specifically deactivating employee access cards. I'm leaning toward \"Access\" as the most appropriate category.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Request**\n\nI've refined my thinking on the ticket category. While HR Support is relevant, the core action is disabling access cards. \"Access\" now seems the most precise classification. The \"leaver\" aspect highlights the context, but the primary task is access management, so that's where I'm placing the priority.\n\n\n**Analyzing the Ticket's Context**\n\nI'm now focusing on the 'leaver' aspect, which is central. Disabling the card is the direct action, and the leaver context strongly points toward \"HR Support\". It's a key part of the offboarding process.  I've concluded that \"HR Support\" best captures the overall intent.\n\n\n**Defining the Core Action**\n\nI'm now prioritizing the action itself: disabling access. While the \"leaver\" context is important, the actual task is managing access rights. I'm leaning heavily towards \"Access\" as the primary category, recognizing that it's a direct IT action.\n\n\n**Choosing the Primary Task**\n\nI'm now wrestling with the categorization again. While \"Access\" highlights the core technical action, the \"leaver\" context consistently nudges me toward \"HR Support.\" It's a tricky one, but \"HR Support\" seems to encompass the broader *reason* for the IT action.\n\n\n**Determining the Core Function**\n\nI've been going back and forth, but the \"leaver\" aspect keeps pulling me toward \"HR Support\". While disabling the card is an \"Access\" issue technically, the core *why* is the employee's departure, which is HR's domain. So, I am now strongly leaning towards \"HR Support\" being the best fit.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Action**\n\nI'm now fully committed to \"HR Support\". The phrase \"leaver\" is the decisive factor; while disabling access *is* the core task, the *reason* for it stems from the employee's departure, a process owned by HR. It's about IT enabling the broader HR workflow.\n\n\n"
