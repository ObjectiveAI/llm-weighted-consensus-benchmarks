I'm actively determining the best-fit category for this request from the provided list.\n\n\n**Defining the Appropriate Category**\n\nI've meticulously analyzed the IT ticket text and evaluated each potential category. The primary goal is establishing remote connection, and while administrative rights could be relevant in certain scenarios, they aren't the primary focus. I've concluded that \"Access\" is the most accurate category, reflecting the user's need for remote connectivity.\n\n\n"
