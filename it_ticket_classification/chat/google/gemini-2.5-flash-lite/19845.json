So far, it seems like a hardware request, likely related to a new monitor purchase. I'm focusing on keywords like \"purchase,\" \"monitor,\" and \"installation\" to determine the final categorization. I'll need to consider the context of the entire ticket to ensure accuracy.\n\n\n**Confirming Purchase Category**\n\nI've honed in on the ticket's core - a clear purchase order for a monitor. Key terms like \"purchase,\" \"order,\" and \"monitor\" solidify this. While installation is mentioned, it's secondary to the purchase itself. The focus is on the procurement and associated documentation. Thus, despite installation being implied, the ticket's primary purpose is centered on the buying process, therefore the 'Purchase' category is suitable.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Activity**\n\nI've been going through the text again, and the recurring keywords like \"purchase,\" \"PO,\" and \"monitor\" solidify that a \"Purchase\" is the primary focus. While \"installation\" is also mentioned, it's clearly secondary to the buying process. The core activity revolves around acquiring the monitor. I'm focusing on the purchase aspect of the request.\n\n\n"
