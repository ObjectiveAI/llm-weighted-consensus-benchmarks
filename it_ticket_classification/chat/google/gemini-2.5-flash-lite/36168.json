I'm carefully analyzing the provided text, particularly the repeated phrase \"failed with errors change manager,\" to determine the most appropriate category from the options. The context hints at a potential system access or administrative rights issue. I'm leaning toward selecting \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access\", but need further analysis before a definitive decision.\n\n\n**Defining Ticket Issue**\n\nI've zeroed in on the core issue: systemic failures impacting the \"change manager\" function.  \"Access task application failed\" strongly suggests an access-related problem. The repeated \"failed with errors\" confirms system instability. I'm moving toward an \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" categorization, but examining \"Internal Project\" as a potential contributor.\n\n\n**Identifying Root Cause**\n\nI'm now focusing on pinpointing the root cause. While \"Internal Project\" is a possibility, \"Access\" seems the most likely, given the consistent \"failed with errors change manager\" and \"access task application\" mentions. It appears a user, possibly in the \"change manager\" role, is experiencing access-related failures when performing tasks or potentially trying to change career elements. I'm exploring the nuances of \"Administrative rights\" but leaning towards \"Access\" as the primary issue.\n\n\n**Pinpointing Ticket Category**\n\nI'm now fully committed to the \"Access\" category. The repeated \"failed with errors\" coupled with \"access task application\" and the central role of \"change manager\" solidify this choice.  The \"career change\" aspect is likely a function within the application experiencing access issues. I've ruled out all other categories based on the ticket's specific content.\n\n\n**Defining Ticket Category**\n\nMy analysis consistently points to \"Access\" as the most suitable category. The repeated \"failed with errors\" coupled with the specific mention of \"access task application\" and the role of \"change manager\" solidify this choice.  The \"career change\" aspect is likely a function within the application, experiencing access-related issues, suggesting a problem with permissions, authentication, or the system's ability to handle user tasks. I'm comfortable moving forward.\n\n\n"
