After careful examination of the text, I'm leaning toward selecting the most suitable category from the options provided. The keywords seem to hint at a new employee onboarding process, but the absence of specific details makes the decision more nuanced. I am considering each category to select the most appropriate one.\n\n\n**Prioritizing HR Focus**\n\nNow, I'm focusing on the \"HR Support\" category, given the new starter form request. The ticket is centered around onboarding, which is primarily an HR concern, potentially needing IT support. I'm prioritizing this and considering access implications.  The wording, while lacking specifics, still indicates onboarding, making \"HR Support\" the most appropriate initial selection.\n\n\n**Selecting Primary Category**\n\nI am now leaning heavily toward selecting \"HR Support\" as the primary category for this ticket. The strong presence of \"new starter\" and \"starter form\" indicates an onboarding process, a core function of HR, and IT often supports these processes. I am finalizing my choice, keeping in mind the need for a single category selection.\n\n\n"
