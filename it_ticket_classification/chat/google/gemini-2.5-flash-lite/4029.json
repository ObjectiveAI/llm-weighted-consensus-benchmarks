The keywords \"new starter,\" \"starting date,\" and \"starter\" have emerged as significant. I'm leaning toward either \"HR Support\" or \"Access\" as the best fit, but I need to ensure a careful review of the exact context to make the most accurate determination.\n\n\n**Categorizing Onboarding Tickets**\n\nI've honed in on the recurring \"starter\" terminology within the ticket. The emphasis on \"starting date\" and related phrases solidifies my initial hunch.  I am increasingly confident in \"HR Support\" as the definitive category, as it aligns perfectly with the described scenario and the implication of onboarding a new team member. I still plan to double-check my assumption, but HR is the most appropriate department.\n\n\n"
