The presence of \"hardware installation\" is a clear indicator, leaning me heavily towards the \"Hardware\" category. I'll need to confirm that this is the primary focus and not a secondary issue, but right now, \"Hardware\" looks like the winner.\n\n\n**Narrowing Category Choices**\n\nI'm now comparing \"Hardware\" and \"Purchase\" categories. The strong evidence for \"hardware installation\" weighs heavily toward \"Hardware.\" While \"Purchase\" is suggested by \"po,\" \"receipt,\" and \"requisition,\" the main request is the hardware installation itself. Ultimately, I'm leaning more towards the 'Hardware' category.\n\n\n**Analyzing Category Options**\n\nMy analysis now focuses on definitively choosing between \"Hardware\" and \"Purchase.\" The presence of \"hardware installation\" solidified \"Hardware\" initially. However, I'm now cross-referencing this against the purchasing keywords \"po\", \"receipt\", and \"requisition.\" While the latter suggests a procurement angle, the ticket's core action is clearly about the installation. I have now completed comparing all options and determined \"Hardware\" is the most precise categorization.\n\n\n"
