My focus is on identifying the `category` field and its allowed enum values, specifically [\"Hardware\", \"HR Support\", \"Access\", \"Miscellaneous\", \"Storage\", \"Purchase\", \"Internal Project\", \"Administrative rights\"]. This information is crucial for accurately categorizing incoming IT tickets.\n\n**Classifying IT Requests**\n\nI'm processing the ticket description, specifically looking for keywords that align with the predefined categories. The repeated mention of \"absences report\" and \"oracle\" strongly suggests a connection to HR-related functionalities. My current assessment leans towards \"HR Support\" as the most fitting classification.\n\n**Processing Ticket Data**\n\nI've reviewed the provided ticket description and correlated it with the available categories. The strong emphasis on \"absences report\" and the mention of \"Oracle\" lead me to conclude that \"HR Support\" is the most fitting classification for this request.\n\n"
