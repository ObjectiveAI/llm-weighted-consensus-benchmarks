Initial reads suggest \"Access\" is the most fitting. However, \"Purchase\" also seems pertinent due to \"assign order cards\". I'm weighing these two options and will update once I've reached a firm decision or need additional input.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Core Issue**\n\nI've honed in on \"Access\" as the primary category, given the emphasis on access card usage and management. Although \"Purchase\" could be a secondary consideration due to the order aspect, the core issue revolves around access control. The \"access cards usage\" and the need to \"assign order cards\" point directly to access management, solidifying my decision.\n\n\n**Reaffirming Access as Primary**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket's core issue, focusing on the recurrent theme of \"access cards usage\" and \"assigning order cards\". While the \"order cards\" element might subtly hint at \"Purchase\", the fundamental problem is access control. The \"cards usage\" and the inherent function of the cards further solidify the \"Access\" category as the most accurate representation of the issue.\n\n\n"
