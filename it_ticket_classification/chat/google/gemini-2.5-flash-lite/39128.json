I'm prioritizing \"ad memberships audit\" and \"delete users from groups\" to determine the most fitting categorization. The current options suggest Access, Administrative rights, or possibly HR Support could be relevant. Further analysis of the context should narrow it down significantly.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Categories**\n\nI've refined the initial analysis. Focusing on the \"ad memberships audit\" and user deletion, I've eliminated less relevant categories. The core issue centers on controlling and auditing access within Active Directory. While \"Administrative rights\" is a possibility, \"Access\" seems the most precise classification since it directly involves managing user group memberships and associated permissions. The keywords strongly point toward an access control function.\n\n\n**Focusing on Access Control**\n\nI've honed in on the central theme: access management within Active Directory. The repeated emphasis on auditing and removing users from groups solidifies this. While administrative rights are a component, the primary function is controlling access. The keywords related to audit, deletion, and membership solidify that access is at the heart of this categorization.\n\n\n**Confirming Access Focus**\n\nI'm now fully confident that \"Access\" is the correct category. The key phrases and overall context overwhelmingly point to access control and management within Active Directory. The requests for auditing group memberships, deleting users from groups, and analyzing memberships all confirm that access is the core issue. I've ruled out Administrative Rights as a primary fit; although relevant, the focus is managing *user access* to resources.\n\n\n\n**Refining Category Selection**\n\nMy focus is now firmly on the \"Access\" category. The detailed analysis of the ticket's text, specifically keywords like \"ad memberships audit\", \"delete users from groups\", and \"access\", confirms this. I've considered \"Administrative Rights\" and \"HR Support\", but \"Access\" is more precise. The consistent theme of membership management and user control, along with the audit emphasis, strongly supports this choice. The analysis reinforces that controlling user access through Active Directory groups is the central function.\n\n\n**Defining the Primary Classification**\n\nI'm now fully confident that the ticket's primary focus is *access management*. Keywords like \"ad memberships audit,\" \"delete users from groups,\" and the emphasis on AD groups solidify this. While administrative rights are a component, the core function is controlling access via group membership. I'm satisfied \"Access\" is the most appropriate.\n\n\n"
