The core seems to be about the \"room finder\" failing to show data, essentially an empty list. My initial thought leans toward categorizing this under \"Data Access\" or \"Resource Access,\" since the app *should* be pulling room information. I've ruled out a direct \"Hardware\" issue since the user mentions the *application* is malfunctioning. Next steps involve exploring if there are other, related categories that might be more appropriate.\n\n\n**Narrowing Data Access Issue**\n\nI've refined my initial assessment. The \"Access\" category feels the best fit, highlighting the core issue: the room finder can't retrieve data. While \"Miscellaneous\" is always an option, \"Access\" is more specific and accurately describes the problem. I'm focusing on why the application isn't accessing the data, rather than any other general, undefined problem. The user's description of a calendar update further strengthens the case for this category because it demonstrates that the data *exists* but is not being reached by the app.\n\n\n**Finalizing Ticket Categorization**\n\nI've honed in on \"Access\" as the best category for this IT ticket. After careful consideration, I'm confident that the core issue is the room finder's inability to retrieve data, rather than a hardware or UI rendering issue. The empty list and the user's description both support this conclusion, making \"Access\" the most specific and accurate descriptor. I believe this categorization reflects the heart of the problem \u2013 the failure of the application to access and present the room information from the existing data source.\n\n\n"
