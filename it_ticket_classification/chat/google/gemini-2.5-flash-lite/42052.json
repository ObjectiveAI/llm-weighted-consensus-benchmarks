I'm exploring related keywords to confirm my hypothesis before making the final determination.\n\n\n**Finalizing the Classification**\n\nI've reviewed the provided information, and the \"HR Support\" category seems to be the clear frontrunner. I've taken into account the keywords \"annual leave\", the process status updates, and the mention of \"hours\". Considering all these elements, I'm confident that this ticket falls squarely within HR-related inquiries.\n\n\n"
