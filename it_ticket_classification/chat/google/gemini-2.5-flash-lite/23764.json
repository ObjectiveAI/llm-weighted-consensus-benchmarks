The keywords \"damaged\" and \"cards\" are prominent. My initial thought is leaning towards \"Access\" due to the mention of access cards and the request to disable them. However, I need to consider if \"Hardware\" might also be applicable, as damaged cards could be considered hardware.\n\n\n**Confirming Category Choice**\n\nI've honed in on the \"Access\" category as the best fit for this ticket. The phrases \"damaged access cards\" and \"disable cards\" are the key indicators. While \"Hardware\" was a consideration, it's less precise than \"Access\" given the context of access control. My analysis ruled out the other categories as irrelevant to the specific issues at hand.\n\n\n"
