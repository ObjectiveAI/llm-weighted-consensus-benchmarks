The core task involves interpreting phrases like \"new site\" and \"attached code\" to best align with available categories such as \"Internal Project\" or \"Access.\"\n\n**Developing Project Classification**\n\nI'm actively categorizing the IT ticket, focusing on keywords like \"new site\" and \"attached code\" to determine if it best fits \"Internal Project\" or another relevant classification. The context of \"under client\" is also being considered to refine the placement.\n\n**Refining Site Creation Category**\n\nI'm continuing to analyze the ticket's request for a \"new site\" and \"attached code\" in the context of \"under client.\" My current focus is determining if \"Internal Project\" best captures the essence of this development or deployment task, or if another category might be more accurate given the client association.\n\n**Categorizing New Site Request**\n\nI'm currently processing the IT ticket, focusing on the phrases \"new site\" and \"attached code,\" along with the \"under client\" context. My aim is to accurately assign it to \"Internal Project\" or another suitable category.\n\n**Refining Project Scope**\n\nI'm currently evaluating the ticket's request for a \"new site\" and \"attached code\" within the context of \"under client.\" My focus is on determining if \"Internal Project\" is the most accurate category for this IT-driven creation and deployment task.\n\n**Developing Site Creation Logic**\n\nI'm currently analyzing the ticket to identify the most fitting category. My focus is on the core actions of creating a \"new site\" and deploying \"attached code,\" while also considering the \"under client\" context to ensure accurate classification.\n\n**Classifying New Site Deployment**\n\nI'm currently analyzing the IT ticket's core request: creating a \"new site\" and deploying \"attached code\" specifically \"under client.\" My assessment is leaning towards categorizing this as an \"Internal Project\" due to the nature of IT-driven creation and deployment tasks, even with the client context.\n\n"
