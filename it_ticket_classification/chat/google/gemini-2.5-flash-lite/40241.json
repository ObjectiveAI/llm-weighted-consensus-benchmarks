My focus is on identifying keywords related to software issues and system upgrades to assign it to the correct classification.\n\n**Determining Software Issues**\n\nI'm focusing on classifying the IT ticket. Based on the description of \"software glitches,\" issues with \"update or save,\" and browser loading errors within ServiceNow following an upgrade, I've determined it's not hardware, HR, access, storage, purchase, internal project, or administrative rights. This strongly suggests a software-related problem.\n\n**Resolving Ticket Category**\n\nI've analyzed the ticket details. The issues described, such as \"software glitches,\" problems with \"update or save,\" and browser loading errors after an upgrade, clearly indicate functional problems within the ServiceNow application. Therefore, I've determined that the \"Miscellaneous\" category is the most appropriate fit among the available options, as a specific \"Software\" or \"Application\" category isn't provided.\n\n**Assigning Ticket Category**\n\nI've thoroughly reviewed the provided ticket details, focusing on the described \"software glitches,\" update/save failures, and browser loading issues within ServiceNow post-upgrade. Considering the available categories, and noting the absence of a specific \"Software\" or \"Application\" classification, I've concluded that \"Miscellaneous\" best encapsulates these functional software-related problems.\n\n**Identifying Ticket Category**\n\nI've been analyzing the ticket's reported issues, specifically focusing on \"software glitches,\" update/save failures, and browser loading problems within ServiceNow post-upgrade.
