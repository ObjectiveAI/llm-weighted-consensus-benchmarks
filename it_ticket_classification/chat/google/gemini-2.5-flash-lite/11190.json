I'm leaning toward \"Miscellaneous\" or perhaps \"Storage,\" considering the \"oracle\" reference. I'll need to analyze the information further to refine the selection.\n\n\n**Categorizing HR-related issues**\n\nI'm now focusing on categorizing the ticket as \"HR Support\". The \"leavers\" mention is pivotal, suggesting employee offboarding. Although access revocation is implied, HR processes are the primary driver here. I'm confident in this choice.\n\n\n**Revisiting Ticket Assignment**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket text with fresh eyes, focusing particularly on \"leavers.\" Initially, it seemed like an access issue, but now I recognize the broader HR implications of managing departing employees. The request likely involves updating systems, but is initiated from HR. I am now certain the best category is \"HR Support,\" as the primary issue seems to revolve around offboarding and associated IT tasks.\n\n\n"
