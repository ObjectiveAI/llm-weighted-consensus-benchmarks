My initial analysis points toward focusing on the core activity described in the text. I am currently honing the criteria for each category to ensure accurate and consistent assignments.\n\n\n**Analyzing HR Ticket Data**\n\nI've determined that this ticket requires categorization under \"HR Support\". The text centers around an employee, Montgomery, who has left the company, and the associated tasks of submitting his time, calculating worked hours, and recording holiday time. This falls squarely within the scope of HR-related administrative processes, confirming my initial assessment.\n\n\n**Assigning HR Ticket Category**\n\nI've determined this ticket unequivocally belongs in \"HR Support\". The text centers on a departing employee, Montgomery, and the necessary administrative steps: submitting time, tracking worked and holiday hours. This aligns perfectly with HR processes, confirming the earlier analysis and my subsequent choice.\n\n\n"
