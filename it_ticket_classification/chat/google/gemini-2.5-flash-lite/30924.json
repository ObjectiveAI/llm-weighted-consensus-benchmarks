I'm prioritizing the identification of key terms within the ticket text. Words like \"remove,\" \"granting,\" and \"rights\" seem crucial.  My plan is to refine how these keywords map to the available categories such as \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" avoiding an initial brute force strategy. I'm working to connect those words to specific categories.\n\n\n**Analyzing Access Requirements**\n\nI've been analyzing the phrases in the ticket text to determine the best categorization.  \"Granting rights,\" \"give rights,\" and \"remove from\" are clear indicators. My analysis strongly points to \"Access\" as the primary category. While \"Administrative rights\" is a possibility, the ticket's scope seems broader, focusing on general user permissions rather than strictly administrative privileges. Therefore, \"Access\" best captures the essence.\n\n\n**Defining Ticket Classification**\n\nMy current focus is defining the best categorization for the ticket. The phrases \"granting rights,\" \"give rights,\" and \"remove from\" are central indicators. The goal is pinpoint accuracy, so I'm honing in on \"Access\" as the primary category. While \"Administrative rights\" is a contender, \"Access\" appears more comprehensive given the leaver scenario.\n\n\n"
