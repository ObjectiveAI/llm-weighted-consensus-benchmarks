The \"new starter\" language really jumps out, and combined with \"creating his,\" the setup of a new employee seems like the core issue. I'm leaning toward \"Access\" since this is often the initial requirement for a new hire. I'll need to consider other options, too.\n\n\n**Analyzing the Ticket Text**\n\nI've refined my thinking and I'm now certain this falls squarely within the realm of HR. The \"new starter\" and \"hire got information about his arrival\" elements point directly to onboarding. While \"Access\" is relevant, \"HR Support\" has a more encompassing scope, perfectly aligning with the initial setup initiated by HR. I've discarded the other categories as they are not relevant. This feels like the solution!\n\n\n"
