I'm analyzing the details provided to accurately assign it to the \"Access\" enum, given the request for a password reset for an external account.\n\n**Assigning Ticket Category**\n\nI'm currently analyzing a ticket. The key phrases \"password reset for external account\" and instructions like \"press ctrl alt delete choose change\" strongly indicate that the most appropriate category from the enum is \"Access\". This reflects the core need for credential management.\n\n**Refining Category Assignment**\n\nI'm re-evaluating the ticket's classification. While initial thoughts leaned towards \"Access\" due to the password reset context, I'm considering whether the extensive disclaimers might necessitate a \"Miscellaneous\" assignment, or if the core functionality remains the primary driver.\n\n"
