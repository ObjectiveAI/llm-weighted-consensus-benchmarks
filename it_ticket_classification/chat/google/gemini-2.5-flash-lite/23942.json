Based on the provided text about the \"end of probation period,\" I'm leaning away from typical IT categories. I'm considering \"HR Support\" as the most relevant, given the context. However, I want to make absolutely sure before providing my final categorization. I am reviewing the options closely to confirm my choice.\n\n\n**Defining the Ticket: HR**\n\nI've just finished analyzing the ticket's text, and it's clear the context revolves around an employee's probationary period. Phrases like \"end of probation,\" \"probation periods,\" and \"communicate decision\" are the key identifiers here. Therefore, my prior categorization of \"HR Support\" appears sound, aligning perfectly with the content. I'm finalizing my decision based on this thorough review.\n\n\n"
