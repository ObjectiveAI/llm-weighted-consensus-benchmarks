I'm carefully reviewing the wording to definitively rule out other potential categories before making a final classification.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Request**\n\nI've further refined my categorization. While \"infrastructure\" was noted, I've confirmed that \"Hardware\" is the most direct fit based on \"security cameras\" and \"install cameras.\" I've ruled out all other categories, and \"Hardware\" clearly aligns with the user's need for physical equipment installation. The request is solely for installation and no associated work with storage, HR, access, administrative rights. The ticket's content leads to a simple resolution of identifying \"Hardware.\"\n\n\n"
