The text within the ticket repeatedly mentions \"leaver form,\" which seems like a strong clue. I'm leaning towards \"HR Support\" because of this repetitive mention of a form related to someone leaving the company, I am also considering \"Access\" due to the possibility of revoking access, but I'll see how the words fit with each category.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Ticket**\n\nThe \"leaver form\" is a central piece. It's clearly about employee departure. I've re-evaluated \"Access\" - it's secondary to the form itself. \"HR Support\" fits best; the form is an HR administrative task. The term appears 6 times and is the core of the request.\n\n\n"
