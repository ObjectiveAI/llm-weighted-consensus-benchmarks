I'm leaning toward \"Internal Project,\" given the focus on a distinct, possibly time-bound initiative. However, I need to consider if \"HR Support\" could also be relevant due to the \"interviews\" element, before confirming.\n\n\n**Analyzing the Ticket's Core**\n\nI'm now focusing on the core purpose of the ticket. The initial leaning toward \"Internal Project\" still seems accurate, even after reviewing. \"Modify template\" access leans towards project setup rather than generic administrative rights. Ultimately, the ticket description clearly outlines a new, internal initiative that necessitates setting up a system or resource.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Project Needs**\n\nI've just refined my reasoning based on further analysis of the keywords. The \"modify template\" rights are now seen as a crucial setup step *within* the scope of this new internal project. It's becoming clearer that the primary concern is the project itself, with the access control being a necessary component of its implementation. This reinforces my initial assessment that \"Internal Project\" is the most appropriate categorization.\n\n\n"
