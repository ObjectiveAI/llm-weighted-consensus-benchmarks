This points strongly towards an access issue, but I'm cross-referencing with other mentions within the ticket text to be certain. I'm keeping an eye out for anything that hints at hardware problems, which could complicate the situation.\n\n\n**Clarifying the Focus**\n\nNow, I'm digging into the nuances of \"Access\" versus \"Administrative rights.\" It's becoming clearer that the crux is the *application* of granted permissions. While the inability to log in is a symptom, the root seems to be a struggle with utilizing those newly granted administrator powers, or a problem despite them. I'm leaning heavily towards \"Administrative rights\" as the precise issue. The repeated emphasis on managing roles and being *unable to* log in despite those permissions solidifies this.\n\n\n**Analyzing the Core Issue**\n\nI'm now fully immersed in the core problem: the user has administrative rights, but there's a problem with their application. The crucial phrase is \"am not able to log into despite having admin rights.\" The ability to manage roles is also mentioned, cementing this as a \"Administrative rights\" problem, rather than a general access issue.\n\n\n"
