The language is a bit vague, but \"device problem\" keeps popping up. I'm leaning toward hardware, though I want to make sure I'm not missing anything. I'm considering possible keywords for each category. I still need to make sure I'm not overlooking any internal project work.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Hardware Issues**\n\nI've determined that the \"Hardware\" category remains the most relevant. I am further evaluating if the \"cards\" mentioned refer to hardware components like network interfaces or storage media. I am now looking at the possibility that it is a direct issue with the test device itself. This is my new working hypothesis, pending further analysis.\n\n\n**Pinpointing Device Malfunction**\n\nThe focus is now squarely on the hardware category. The user's query about \"cards\" continues to be a key indicator. I'm exploring the nuances of \"test device problem\". I am carefully analyzing the implications of the \"cards\" reference, considering if it points to network interfaces, storage media, or other physical components. I am developing an initial assessment.\n\n\n"
