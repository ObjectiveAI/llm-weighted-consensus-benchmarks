I'm leaning toward \"Hardware\" but need more context. I'm also considering the other categories to make sure I don't overlook a critical detail.\n\n\n**Analyzing Access Issues**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the ticket's text, and access-related issues are becoming increasingly prominent. The \"not working when connected\" could also tie into access. The attempted certificate fix strongly suggests access problems. Based on the current information, I'm leaning toward \"Access\" as the primary category, with perhaps a secondary tag for hardware if it's relevant. I also considered the ambiguous phrasing: \"have works correctly but then have access.\"\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Culprit**\n\nI've carefully re-evaluated the ticket. While \"not working when connected\" initially pointed towards hardware, the deeper dive into the phrasing \"have access\" and the certificate attempt solidifies \"Access\" as the primary category. The attached image offers an opportunity for additional insights, but the ticket's text leans heavily toward access control problems. I'm now certain I've chosen the right area.\n\n\n"
