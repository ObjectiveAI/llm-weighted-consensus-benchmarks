Initial keywords strongly suggest the ticket pertains to access card management: reissuing, replacements, and functionality. I'm focusing on \"card\" as the primary element. My goal is to capture the core intent of the ticket.\n\n\n**Refining the Access Category**\n\nI've got the ticket categorized as \"Access,\" which feels right. I'm drilling down into the specific phrases: \"reinstate,\" \"re working,\" \"lost,\" \"replacement,\" \"assign,\" and \"damaged.\" These strongly reinforce the need for the \"Access\" category. The goal is a precise label.\n\n\n"
