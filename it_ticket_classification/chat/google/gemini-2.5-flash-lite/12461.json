                    "reasoning": "**Categorizing Ticket Text**\n\nI'm currently focused on categorizing the provided IT ticket text: \"changes july pm changes hi please add weekly change procedure myself thanks discipline lead.\" My initial thought is that \"changes\" and \"procedure\" suggest a potential fit with the \"Internal Project\" category or possibly \"Access.\" I am now carefully considering each word to narrow down the best fit. I am also thinking about all the possible categories, even the ones which may not be a perfect fit.\n\n\n**Defining Ticket's Scope**\n\nI've been analyzing the ticket text and available categories to pinpoint the most relevant one. \"Weekly change procedure\" is the core of this ticket. I'm leaning toward \"Internal Project\" as the closest match, assuming the procedure is part of an ongoing initiative. If not, \"Miscellaneous\" might be the fallback due to the lack of clear-cut category, although that seems less precise. Now I'm carefully comparing the attributes to each category, hoping for the best fit.\n\n\n**Assessing Project Connection**\n\nI'm now carefully examining the connection between the \"weekly change procedure\" request and the \"Internal Project\" category. I'm leaning away from assuming this ticket represents a distinct project. Instead, the focus seems to be on a general operational enhancement. The key is in clarifying the scope to definitively place it, leaning towards a generalized category if the project-based link isn't strongly present.\n\n\n**Defining Procedure Scope**\n\nI'm now carefully examining the request for the \"weekly change procedure.\" I'm questioning if it represents a defined project. The ticket text strongly suggests an operational process request more than a project-based one. I'm hesitant to put it in \"Internal Project\" as the scope is not defined as part of a particular initiative, but rather a more general IT procedure. I'm exploring if \"Miscellaneous\" might be the best, although less specific, option, given that a project association is not readily apparent.\n\n\n**Categorizing the IT Request**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the ticket text and available categories, leaning towards \"Internal Project.\" The \"add weekly change procedure\" request indicates a formalized process implementation, potentially aligning with internal IT project initiatives. However, if the scope is purely operational, \"Miscellaneous\" might be the better fit as a fallback, given the lack of project specificity.\n\n\n**Analyzing Procedure Scope**\n\nI've been working on determining the correct classification for the IT ticket. I'm focusing intently on whether the request for a \"weekly change procedure\" represents a defined project with clear objectives. I'm leaning toward \"Internal Project\" if this is a process initiative, and I'm prepared to use \"Miscellaneous\" if the scope is not clearly defined, though that seems unlikely.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Process Request**\n\nMy assessment of the ticket text continues. I'm focusing on classifying the \"weekly change procedure\" request, now leaning firmly towards \"Internal Project.\" This classification accounts for procedure development within the IT sphere, assuming it represents a process improvement initiative. I'm satisfied that \"Internal Project\" best captures the nature of this task.\n\n\n"
