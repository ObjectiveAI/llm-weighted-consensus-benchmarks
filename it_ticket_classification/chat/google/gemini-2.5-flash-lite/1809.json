My current task involves matching ticket descriptions against a predefined JSON schema. The primary objective is to assign a `category` from the available options: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" or \"Purchase.\" This will streamline ticket routing and resolution processes.\n\n**Refining Ticket Classification**\n\nI'm refining my approach to categorize IT tickets. My latest focus is on the \"Internal Project\" and \"Administrative rights\" categories, as the ticket text specifically mentions \"project epics\" and label management. I'm weighing these against \"Miscellaneous\" to ensure the most accurate assignment.\n\n**Determining Project Label Category**\n\nI've analyzed the provided ticket text, focusing on terms like \"project epics\" and \"labels\" in the context of deletion due to confusion. Considering the available categories, \"Internal Project\" appears to be the most fitting classification for this request, reflecting work related to managing project elements.\n\n**Classifying Project Management Labels**\n\nI've concluded that the ticket concerning the deletion of labels from \"project epics\" should be classified under \"Internal Project.\" This decision is based on the explicit mention of project management constructs and the request to modify elements within that context.\n\n"
