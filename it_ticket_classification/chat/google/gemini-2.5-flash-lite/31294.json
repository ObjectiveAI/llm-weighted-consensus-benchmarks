My current approach involves analyzing keywords. \"Purchase order requisition\" seems key, recurring several times. Based on this, I'm leaning toward the \"Purchase\" category, but I need to ensure there are no other relevant aspects. I'll re-read the full ticket text to confirm.\n\n\n**Pinpointing Key Indicators**\n\nI've honed in on the strongest signals within the ticket text. The repeated mentions of \"purchase order requisition\" and related terms like \"supplier\" and \"ordered\" are undeniable. This directly links to procurement, which reinforces \"Purchase\" as the most suitable category. I've ruled out other categories as no aspects pertain to the listed criteria.\n\n\n"
