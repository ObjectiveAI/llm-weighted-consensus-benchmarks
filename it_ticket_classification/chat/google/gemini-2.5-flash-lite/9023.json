The phrases \"line management change,\" \"initiating change,\" and \"structure tried\" have me leaning toward \"Internal Project.\" However, the lack of specific details makes me hesitant to rule out \"HR Support\" or \"Miscellaneous\" completely. More context would be helpful, but I'm currently prioritizing \"Internal Project\" as the most likely fit.\n\n\n**Categorizing Ticket: Evolving**\n\nI'm now revising my initial assessment, shifting from \"Internal Project\" to \"HR Support\" as the primary category. The \"line management change\" and \"change structure\" phrases point decisively towards HR-related actions. The phrase \"pm change\" further strengthens this interpretation. While organizational changes can sometimes be internal projects, this request seems rooted in personnel adjustments.\n\n\n**Final Ticket Classification**\n\nI've solidified my classification; \"HR Support\" is the definite match. The phrase \"line management change\" is pivotal, definitively linking the ticket to personnel-related adjustments. \"PM change\", likely meaning Project Manager change, further confirms the HR connection. The overarching request is about structural adaptation, further solidifying my categorization.\n\n\n"
