I've analyzed the text, focusing on keywords like \"annual leave\" and \"balance.\" While it seems HR-related, there's a strong technical aspect to it, specifically referencing \"Oracle.\" I'm leaning towards \"HR Support\" but considering \"Access\" as the next closest choice, weighing the impact of annual leave balance management to the user's access.\n\n\n**Finalizing the Classification**\n\nI've reviewed the IT ticket's content, focusing on the keywords. It's clearly about \"annual leave balance\" and \"reduced leave,\" which are core HR functions. Though Oracle is mentioned, the issue revolves around employee leave management. Considering the available categories, \"HR Support\" appears the most suitable. I'm finalizing the categorization as \"HR Support\" now.\n\n\n"
