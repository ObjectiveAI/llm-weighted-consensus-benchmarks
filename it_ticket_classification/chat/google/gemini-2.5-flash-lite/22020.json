The text contains phrases related to new employees, like \"new starter Friday PM\" and \"re-starter form\". I need to determine if this falls under HR Support, Access, or potentially a broader category. I am working through the nuances of the phrases to find the best fit.\n\n\n**Prioritizing HR Support**\n\nI've been evaluating the given text and the potential categories. The phrases \"new starter,\" \"re-starter form,\" and similar ones are clearly pointing toward an onboarding scenario. After considering options, I've eliminated \"Hardware,\" \"Storage,\" and \"Purchase.\" \"Miscellaneous\" is too broad, and \"Internal Project\" doesn't fit the context. While \"Access\" is relevant, \"HR Support\" appears the primary need as the \"starter form\" indicates.\n\n\n**Evaluating Initial Onboarding Setup**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and the available categories again. The phrases point squarely towards onboarding. \"HR Support\" still feels the most accurate, though \"Access\" is closely related. I considered \"Administrative rights\", but the focus is on the initial setup, not ongoing permissions. While the ticket touches on systems access, the HR aspect \u2013 specifically the \"starter form\" \u2013 is the key driver, making \"HR Support\" the best fit.\n\n\n"
