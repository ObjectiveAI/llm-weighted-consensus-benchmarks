It's a bit of a word salad, but the key phrase seems to be about \"annual leave\" and submission issues. I am leaning towards \"HR Support\" as the most relevant category.\n\n\n**Revisiting Category Assignment**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket description, focusing on the user's struggle to submit \"annual leaves\" and enter \"backdated leaves.\" This points firmly toward an HR-related system malfunction. While \"Access\" could be a factor, the primary issue is the inability to perform an HR task. Therefore, \"HR Support\" remains the most accurate categorization, reflecting a problem with the HR system's functionality.\n\n\n"
