The phrases \"amendments for ms shared infra\" and \"shared infra\" strongly suggest \"Storage\" or potentially \"Internal Project.\" I'm carefully weighing these options against the other categories to make the most accurate assignment.\n\n\n**Pinpointing Project Scope**\n\nThe \"cr form\" and \"change planning\" details strongly indicate a managed change. Analyzing key phrases, I'm leaning toward \"Internal Project.\" The \"log assign requests\" and \"resources changed\" further support this, suggesting a broader IT-driven project rather than a simple storage issue or hardware fix. I am now certain of the category.\n\n\n**Defining the Best Match**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket's core function. The focus is on implementing changes to shared infrastructure and the \"CR form\" strongly suggests this is within the realm of an internal project. Keywords like \"resources changed\" and \"log assign requests\" reinforce the project-related nature. Based on this, \"Internal Project\" best captures the scope of work and the formal change management process.\n\n\n"
