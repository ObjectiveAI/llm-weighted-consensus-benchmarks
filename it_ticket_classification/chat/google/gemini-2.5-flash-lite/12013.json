So far, the terms \"joiners\" and \"leavers\" point me towards either HR Support or Access, though I am still evaluating. I'm focusing on the overall context to make a definitive categorization.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Priority**\n\nI've refined my thinking by focusing on the core action: managing user accounts. The keywords \"joiners\" and \"leavers\" clearly indicate employee lifecycle events. While \"Access\" is relevant, \"HR Support\" appears to be the most encompassing category, as it addresses the HR-driven need for IT changes related to employees joining or leaving. The date information adds context but doesn't change the core focus. I'm leaning heavily towards \"HR Support\" now.\n\n\n**Defining the Category Again**\n\nI'm now fully convinced that \"HR Support\" is the most apt category for this ticket. After considering \"Access,\" I've concluded that \"HR Support\" better captures the overarching reason for the IT work: the employee lifecycle event. The text suggests an HR-driven request to manage access for new hires and departing employees, so the HR category is most relevant here. The other categories are either irrelevant or too specific compared to the holistic view of the ticket.\n\n\n"
