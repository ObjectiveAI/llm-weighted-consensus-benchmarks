I'm building a system to translate words found in the ticket text to a category label. I've begun associating keywords with the categories. Currently, I'm working on expanding the keyword list for each potential category.\n\n\n**Identifying Relevant Phrases**\n\nI've been poring over the ticket text, aiming to identify key phrases and their contexts. The text is repetitive and a bit unclear, so I'm focusing on extracting the most meaningful segments. I'm starting to build a map between these phrases and the potential categories. I have a initial list.\n\n\n**Categorizing Ticket Content**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the text's core meaning. Key phrases are emerging: \"cannot update,\" \"default approvers,\" and \"custom created.\" These point strongly toward an \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" category. The focus is now on confirming this association and refining it. I'm building out a list of criteria to make this assignment reliably.\n\n\n**Assigning Ticket Category**\n\nI'm zeroing in on the \"Access\" category, solidifying it based on key phrases. \"Default approvers disabled\" and the inability to \"receive invite\" strongly suggest an access or permission issue. I'm now crafting the final JSON object, confident in this categorization.\n\n\n**Defining the Ticket Type**\n\nI'm solidifying my approach, focusing on the core problem: this ticket is about a system misconfiguration causing access issues. \"Access\" is the most accurate category, given the problems with user creation, invitations, and permissions. I've ruled out \"Administrative rights\" as the user isn't directly *requesting* admin privileges but rather pointing to an existing problem with access settings. The JSON object will reflect this.\n\n\n"
