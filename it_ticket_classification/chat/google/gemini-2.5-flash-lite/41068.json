Identifying the problem seems straightforward, but I need to accurately pinpoint the affected area. The mention of \"red sockets\" and \"sd area\" is crucial. I'm prioritizing the information from this ticket to decide how to respond with the most relevant information and the correct classification.\n\n\n**Classifying Ticket Issue**\n\nI've analyzed the ticket content, pinpointing \"red sockets\" and \"sd area\" as key. It appears to be a hardware problem, specifically related to non-functional network ports or similar. The user requests functionality restoration. I'm confidently classifying this as \"Hardware\", as the issue lies within physical infrastructure and requires fixing. Other categories are irrelevant: No HR or access concerns. My analysis points firmly to the need for hardware troubleshooting.\n\n\n**Determining the Ticket Category**\n\nI've examined the ticket content focusing on keywords like \"red sockets\" and \"sd area,\" revealing a hardware/network issue. The request is to restore functionality to these specific components. I've ruled out all other categories, specifically HR, Access, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project and Administrative rights, as they are not relevant to the problem at hand. \"Hardware\" clearly aligns with the core issue of non-functional \"sockets.\"\n\n\n"
