The repeated mentions of \"router failure\" and \"equipment\" strongly suggest a hardware problem. This seems like the most likely category based on the provided options. I need to confirm this is the primary focus.\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nMy focus remains firmly on the hardware issue. The extensive use of phrases like \"router failure,\" \"equipment dead,\" and the need for a \"replacement router\" solidify \"Hardware\" as the most suitable category. I'm now confident in this assessment, considering the repeated references to physical equipment malfunction.\n\n\n"
