My focus is on extracting keywords and context from the provided text to align it with one of the available enum options.\n\n**Selecting the Category**\n\nI've analyzed the ticket's details, focusing on the hardware-related components, incompatibilities, and requests for replacements and quotes. Based on this, \"Hardware\" is the most fitting classification.\n\n**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI've thoroughly reviewed the provided text, identifying key elements such as ordered but incompatible hardware, requests for quotes on replacements, and mentions of upgrades for older equipment. Based on these factors, I've concluded that \"Hardware\" is the most fitting and precise category.\n\n"
