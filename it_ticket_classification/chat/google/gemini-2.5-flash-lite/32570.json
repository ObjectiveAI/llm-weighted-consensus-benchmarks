While the \"removed feature\" portion is also key, I am focusing on the common denominator to properly categorize the ticket.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and recurring phrases, specifically focusing on \"listen to calls\" and \"listen extension\". It's leading me toward the \"Access\" category, as the issue fundamentally revolves around granting or managing access to this feature, which is likely related to call monitoring or recording. While administrative rights are a possibility, \"Access\" feels more directly aligned with the granular permission request.\n\n\n**Confirming Access Focus**\n\nI'm now fully confident that the \"Access\" category is the best fit. Analyzing recurring phrases like \"allow\" and \"listen\" confirms this focus. The granting, removing, or modification of \"listen\" permissions is the core of the issue.\n\n\n"
