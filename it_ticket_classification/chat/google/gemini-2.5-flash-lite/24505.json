While \"installing\" and \"license key\" point towards software, the mention of \"workstation requested\" introduces a potential hardware component. I'm weighing whether to categorize this as a \"Purchase\" due to the implied licensing, or if the workstation request pushes it closer to \"Hardware.\"\n\n**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm currently assessing the IT ticket text to pinpoint the most accurate category. My focus is on phrases like \"install professional tool,\" \"workstation requested,\" and \"install license key\" to distinguish between potential \"Purchase\" or \"Hardware\" classifications.\n\n**Procuring Software Licenses**\n\nI'm currently determining the best category for this IT ticket. The phrases \"install professional tool\" and \"install license key needed\" strongly suggest the need for software procurement or license management, leaning me towards the \"Purchase\" category.\n\n**Assigning Software Licenses**\n\nI'm currently assessing the IT ticket. The phrases \"install professional tool\" and \"install license key needed\" strongly suggest the need for software procurement or license management, leaning me towards the \"Purchase\" category.\n\n**Identifying Software Procurement Need**\n\nI'm currently reviewing the IT ticket. The phrases \"install professional tool\" and \"install license key needed\" strongly indicate that software procurement or license acquisition is the primary requirement, steering me towards the \"Purchase\" category.\n\n**Assigning Software Procurement Need**\n\nI'm currently evaluating the IT ticket's core requirement. The mention of needing to \"install professional tool\" alongside a \"license key needed\" strongly suggests that software acquisition or licensing management is the primary focus, leading me to categorize this as a \"Purchase\" request.\n\n**Purchasing Software Licenses**\n\nI'm currently evaluating the IT ticket's core requirement. The mention of needing to \"install professional tool\" alongside a \"license key needed\" strongly suggests that software acquisition or licensing management is the primary focus, leading me to categorize this as a \"Purchase\" request.\n\n**Categorizing Software License Need**\n\nI'm currently evaluating the IT ticket's core requirement. The mention of needing to \"install professional tool\" alongside a \"license key needed\" strongly suggests that software acquisition or licensing management is the primary focus, leading me to categorize this as a \"Purchase\" request.\n\n**Seeking Software License Procurement**\n\nI'm currently assessing the IT ticket's core requirement.
