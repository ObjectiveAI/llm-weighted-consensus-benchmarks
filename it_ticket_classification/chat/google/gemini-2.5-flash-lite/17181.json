So far, \"new\" and \"starter\" seem relevant, pointing potentially toward \"HR Support\" or \"Access\". I'm still trying to find definitive clues to help make the decision, and would appreciate any relevant input.\n\n\n**Assessing Keyword Relevance**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the keywords within the ticket text to determine the best fit among our IT categories. The phrase \"new starter\" is a clear indicator, supporting both \"HR Support\" and \"Access\" options. I'm leaning toward \"Access\" as a potentially more encompassing category, but still examining the context to confirm. I'm also mindful of the available categories and considering how this ticket fits relative to each option.\n\n\n**Narrowing the Focus**\n\nI'm now carefully examining the ticket text and available categories to pinpoint the most appropriate classification. Initial keywords are indicating the focus revolves around \"new starter\" and an onboarding event. My thought process is now emphasizing the likely origin of this IT request. I'm taking a close look at the phrasing to refine my understanding of the request.\n\n\n**Revisiting Category Context**\n\nI've been re-evaluating the best category, focusing on the context of this IT request. The \"new starter\" phrase keeps leading me to a broader process perspective. While access is a component, the nature of the request, with the \"new starter\" cue, really points toward an overall onboarding domain, which fits \"HR Support\". The ticket is, after all, an IT request that arises because HR needs a new employee supported.\n\n\n\n**Defining the Context**\n\nMy analysis of the IT ticket has now culminated in a firm decision. Based on the keywords and available categories, I believe this ticket best fits under \"HR Support\". The phrase \"new starter\" is key. While access is involved, it's a part of the broader onboarding process that HR initiates. Therefore, \"HR Support\" reflects the request's origin and broader context, and is the most appropriate.\n\n\n"
