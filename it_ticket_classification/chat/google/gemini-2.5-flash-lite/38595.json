The keywords \"ram upgrade\" and \"developers\" suggest a potential focus on either \"Hardware\" or \"Access\". My current line of thinking leans towards \"Hardware\" as the primary concern, but I'm keeping \"Access\" open as a secondary consideration. I'm focusing on the core issue to provide a clear categorization.\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nMy focus remains on \"Hardware\" as the central category, given the explicit \"ram upgrade\" request. While the mentions of \"developers,\" \"engineers,\" and \"projects\" initially broadened my view, they now seem secondary to the hardware need. The user's need for an upgrade to support their work further solidifies the hardware classification. I'm now certain \"Hardware\" is the primary need.\n\n\n"
