The core of the issue seems to revolve around Oracle user access for departing employees, specifically difficulties in locating their accounts. Considering the options, \"Access\" seems the most fitting. I'm exploring whether nuances in the ticket prompt consideration of another option, or additional information should be sought from the submitter.\n\n\n**Assessing HR Relationship**\n\nI'm now considering the HR aspect of the ticket. While \"Access\" seemed initially relevant, the link to \"leavers\" makes \"HR Support\" a strong candidate. Access issues usually involve permissions. The core here is users not appearing, which aligns with HR's offboarding procedures within Oracle. Further investigation is needed to clarify if this stems from access rights or an HR data issue.\n\n\n**Resolving HR Connection**\n\nI've decided to refine the category to \"HR Support\". While initially \"Access\" seemed plausible due to the user search element, the context of \"leavers\" shifted my perspective. The problem of missing users aligns more closely with HR's offboarding workflows, suggesting a need for IT to support that. The focus isn't about granting or denying access, but about the data itself, which is often managed by HR. This seems like a clear win.\n\n\n"
