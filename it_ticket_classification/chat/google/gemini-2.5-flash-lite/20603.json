Analyzing the text, I've identified key terms like \"agile evolution\" and \"assign members.\" This leads me to believe it's related to project management and team access. I'm leaning towards \"Access\" or \"Internal Project\" as the best fit. I will continue to refine my analysis to pinpoint the most accurate classification.\n\n\n**Revising Category Choice**\n\nAfter further thought, I've decided to refine my previous assessment. The ticket's focus seems to be on granting access to the \"agile evolution\" project. While \"Internal Project\" felt initially appropriate, the primary action is adding members and assigning them, which directly implies an access-related function. Therefore, \"Access\" is the more precise and suitable classification, better capturing the essence of the user's request.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Ticket**\n\nI've decided to solidify the ticket's classification as \"Access.\" After careful consideration of all options, the language used \u2013 specifically \"add people,\" \"add members,\" and \"assign\" \u2013 consistently points to access management. The \"agile evolution\" project is the context, but the request focuses on granting project membership, confirming \"Access\" as the primary need. It's not a question of project initiation, but rather user permissions within that project.\n\n\n"
