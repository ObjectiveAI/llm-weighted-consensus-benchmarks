The text indicates \"new interns,\" \"hardware allocation,\" and a \"starter form.\" This strongly suggests the need to set up new employee access and possibly hardware. I'm leaning toward either \"Access\" or \"Hardware,\" but I need to consider which is the primary need.\n\n\n**Pinpointing Primary Need**\n\nI've re-evaluated the categorization, focusing on the core request. It's becoming clearer. \"New interns\" need \"hardware\" and have \"starter forms,\" pointing toward a setup process. Although \"hardware\" is involved, the holistic process of onboarding new employees, including access setup triggered by an HR \"starter form,\" feels key. I'm now strongly considering \"HR Support\" because this initiates the setup request.\n\n\n**Analyzing Onboarding Needs**\n\nI'm now fully focused on the onboarding process for the new interns. I've considered keywords like \"starter form\" and \"hardware allocation,\" which clearly point towards a new employee setup scenario. My analysis indicates that \"HR Support\" is the most relevant category. \"Hardware allocation\" is an output of HR requesting IT services to support new hires. I'm confident about this categorization.\n\n\n"
