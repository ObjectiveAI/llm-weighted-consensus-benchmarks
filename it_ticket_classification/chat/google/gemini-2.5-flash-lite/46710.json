Based on this, I've concluded the issue most likely pertains to faulty equipment rather than software, HR, or access problems. Therefore, I'm categorizing it as \"Hardware.\"\n\n**Refining Ticket Categorization**\n\nI've reviewed the IT ticket concerning audio problems during meetings. My initial thought leaned towards \"Hardware,\" and after comparing the specifics of intermittent audio issues with the available categories, I've confirmed \"Hardware\" is indeed the most fitting classification.\n\n"
