My focus is on accurately assigning it to one of the predefined categories: [\"Hardware\", \"HR Support\", \"Access\", \"Miscellaneous \", \"Storage\", \"Purchase\", \"Internal Project\", \"Administrative rights\"]. The description strongly indicates an employee departure, which will likely guide my categorization.\n\n**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm refining the classification of an IT ticket. The presence of numerous terms like \"leaver,\" \"leaving date,\" and specific account management actions strongly points towards a de-provisioning scenario. This suggests a need to focus on the \"Access\" category, as it most directly addresses the described IT operations related to an employee's departure.\n\n**Refining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm continuing to analyze the IT ticket, and based on the strong recurring keywords like \"leaver,\" \"ad rights,\" and \"mailbox management,\" I'm solidifying my assessment. The primary focus is on de-provisioning and access revocation, making \"Access\" the most fitting classification.\n\n"
