After considering the request \"update the lock screen with the annual it survey link message update,\" I'm leaning towards \"Miscellaneous.\" The update itself doesn't seem to fit neatly into other categories, though I'm still weighing my options. I'm taking another look at the list of options to see if something else feels more appropriate. I'm now certain on Miscellaneous.\n\n\n**Re-Evaluating the Categories**\n\nI've been re-evaluating the category options, and now I'm leaning toward \"Internal Project.\" This request is essentially an IT-driven initiative to promote the annual survey by updating system configurations. It's not a standard hardware or user support issue, but more of a targeted campaign. After careful consideration, I'm now fairly certain that internal project is the most fitting.\n\n\n**Confirming Internal Focus**\n\nI'm now fully confident that \"Internal Project\" is the correct category for this ticket. The core activity involves configuring multiple lock screens to publicize the annual IT survey. This is a deliberate, planned initiative, not a reactive fix or standard support request. It perfectly aligns with an internal IT-led project aimed at achieving a specific objective, which is promoting the satisfaction survey. This is the conclusion I've come to now.\n\n\n**Analyzing Project Scope**\n\nThe objective is clear: promote the IT survey through lock screen updates. This requires a configuration change across multiple systems. This task feels very much like it fits within the context of an internal IT project with a clear goal. It is not tied to hardware, HR, storage, purchase, or admin rights; internal project seems correct. The \"miscellaneous\" category appears less specific for this well-defined internal initiative.\n\n\n"
