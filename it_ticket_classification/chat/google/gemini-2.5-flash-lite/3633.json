I'm exploring NLP techniques to better understand the nuances of the requests. I am working on how to handle jumbled and unstructured text, aiming for more robust category assignments.\n\n\n**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI've zeroed in on the \"laptop\" keyword, which definitively points to the \"Hardware\" category. Though there are other terms like \"prices\" suggesting \"Purchase,\" the primary focus seems hardware-related. I need to consider the broader context of the request, even when the provided ticket text is unstructured and jumbled.\n\n\n**Finalizing Hardware Focus**\n\nI've decided to prioritize \"Hardware\" as the primary category, given the clear presence of \"laptop\" and \"backpack.\" The focus will be \"Hardware.\" The \"prices\" element seemed less central.  I'm now confident in the categorization based on the available information.\n\n\n"
