The recurring themes of \"approval rules,\" \"flows,\" and potential \"supplier\" issues are leading me towards a more precise classification.\n\n**Analyzing Ticket Details**\n\nI'm reviewing the provided text to pinpoint the most suitable category. The mention of \"approval rule,\" \"approval flow,\" and potential \"supplier\" issues strongly points towards a functional or process-related concern.\n\n**Classifying Ticket Context**\n\nI'm currently analyzing the provided ticket text to determine its core issue. My focus is on discerning whether the \"approval rule\" and \"supplier rejected\" mentions pertain to a specific transactional process, leaning towards a procurement context.\n\n**Focusing on Procurement Logic**\n\nI'm now emphasizing the \"supplier rejected\" and \"approval rule\" elements, which strongly suggest a purchase-related workflow issue. This refined focus is steering me towards the \"Purchase\" category for this ticket.\n\n"
