Based on the mention of \"leaver form,\" I'm leaning towards \"HR Support\" as the most fitting category from the available options.\n\n**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm analyzing the IT ticket keywords such as \"leaver form,\" \"ad rights,\" and \"mailbox\" to pinpoint the most accurate classification. My current assessment strongly suggests \"HR Support\" is the primary category due to the explicit mention of \"leaver form\" and related processes.\n\n**Processing Employee Departures**\n\nI'm currently evaluating the IT ticket, and the strong indicators like \"leaver form\" and related terms point decisively towards \"HR Support\" as the most suitable classification. This reflects the HR-initiated nature of the request.\n\n**Classifying Employee Exit Procedures**\n\nI've thoroughly analyzed the ticket's content, noting keywords like \"leaver form,\" \"leaving date,\" and various access/mailbox management tasks. Given the explicit mention of HR documentation and the overall context of employee departure, \"HR Support\" remains the most fitting classification, as it captures the HR-driven nature of the request.\n\n**Reviewing Leaver Procedures**\n\nI'm reviewing the IT ticket content, and the explicit mention of \"leaver form\" and associated departure details strongly indicates that \"HR Support\" is the most appropriate classification. This categorization accurately reflects the HR-driven nature of the request.\n\n"
