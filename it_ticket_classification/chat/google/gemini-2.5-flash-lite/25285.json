The initial leaning was towards \"Access\", since name changes often necessitate system access updates. However, given the broader scope, encompassing record creation and database entries, I'm considering \"HR Support\" as a strong contender, since this is an employee related change and would typically be handled by the HR team. I'm carefully weighing whether the technical aspects are a subset of the HR process, and need to make a judgment based on that.\n\n\n**Confirming Category Choice**\n\nI've solidified my choice of \"HR Support.\" While \"Access\" had some initial appeal due to the potential for affected system permissions, the fundamental nature of the request centers on personal data updates, aligning directly with HR's responsibilities. I'm confident that the \"HR Support\" category accurately reflects the essence of this ticket and its primary focus.\n\n\n"
