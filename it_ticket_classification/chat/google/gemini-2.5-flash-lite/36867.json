Based on the text referencing \"missing time days doubled\" and simply \"days doubled,\" my initial inclination leans towards an \"HR Support\" issue, potentially related to payroll or timekeeping. However, \"Administrative rights\" is a possibility. I'll need to further assess the context to make a definitive decision.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Issue**\n\nThe analysis points strongly to \"HR Support\" as the most suitable category. The ticket's content, focusing on missing time, doubled days, time submission, approvals, and manager notifications, strongly aligns with HR-related processes. While \"Internal Project\" could be a possibility, \"HR Support\" captures the essence of the problem more precisely.\n\n\n"
