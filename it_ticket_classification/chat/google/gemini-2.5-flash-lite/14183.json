After a second look, \"HR Support\" seems like the most fitting option, considering the context of hiring and interviews mentioned in the text.\n\n\n**Defining Ticket Type Further**\n\nOkay, taking another look at the ticket text, the need to share \"testing discipline hiring interviews assessors\" is key. While access might be *needed* for that sharing, the *request itself* revolves around HR processes. The layouts mentioned at the end seem like formatting or templates for interview assessments. Considering this, I'm now leaning even more strongly toward \"HR Support\" as the definitive category. This covers the essence of the ticket's concern, making it the most accurate choice.\n\n\n**Confirming Ticket Category**\n\nI've carefully re-examined the ticket text, focusing on the core activity. The recurring phrase \"hiring interviews assessors\" is a dead giveaway for HR-related work. While access might be *required* to share this info, the request itself is rooted in HR processes. The layouts appear to be templates, so that reinforces \"HR Support\" as the best categorization.\n\n\n"
