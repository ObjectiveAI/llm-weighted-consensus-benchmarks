I'm focusing on key terms to determine the best category. \"Device,\" \"meeting room,\" and \"connect\" suggest a potential hardware issue. I'm also considering other possibilities, though \"Hardware\" seems the most likely based on initial parsing.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Possibilities**\n\nI'm leaning towards \"Hardware\" as the primary category, with the keywords heavily supporting this. I've eliminated several other categories, such as HR Support, Access (though it's a minor possibility), and Storage, as they lack relevance to the ticket's language. The focus remains on identifying the specific hardware issue within the meeting room, as the text strongly hints at a connection problem with a device in that location.\n\n\n**Revisiting Hardware Assumption**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket, focusing on \"connect to device\" and \"tower meeting room.\" \"Same issue\" suggests an ongoing problem. I'm prioritizing \"Hardware,\" as the core issue seems device connectivity. I've ruled out \"Access\" as secondary, and the other categories are irrelevant. The device is the central point. I'll search for specific keywords related to connectivity.\n\n\n"
