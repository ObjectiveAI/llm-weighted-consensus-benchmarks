I'm trying to identify key terms and phrases that would point me to the correct category. \"Absence calendar\" seems relevant. I'm considering HR Support as the most likely category, but I need to make sure before confirming.\n\n\n**Narrowing down the options**\n\nI've narrowed it down to HR Support. The \"absence calendar\" term is a strong indicator. I'm focusing on the context of \"assign to,\" which could relate to managing someone's time off within the HR system. I'm excluding the other categories because they don't seem applicable based on the ticket text.\n\n\n**Revisiting Key Indicators**\n\nNow, I'm focusing on the \"assign to\" phrase. I think it is an instruction for the person responsible for the absence calendar to update something. The \"Absence calendar\" confirms HR Support as the correct category, with the ticket possibly describing an assignment or update. This feels like the right direction.\n\n\n"
