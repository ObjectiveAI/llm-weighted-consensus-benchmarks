I need to select a category from the predefined list, considering keywords like \"create external users\" and \"restrict board view\" within the context of the available options: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights.\n\n\n**Analyzing Ticket Details Further**\n\nI've delved deeper into the ticket's text, identifying core themes of user management and access control. Phrases like \"create external users,\" \"restrict board view,\" and mentions of Confluence point strongly towards access-related issues. While \"Administrative rights\" was considered, \"Access\" feels more precise for user permission and resource management, making it my preferred categorization choice.\n\n\n"
