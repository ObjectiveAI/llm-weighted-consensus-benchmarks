I'm leaning toward selecting \"HR Support\" as the appropriate classification for this IT ticket.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Best Fit**\n\nI'm now quite sure that \"HR Support\" is the right category. The repetition of \"card\" and the focus on time and leave records solidifies this. The issue isn't about hardware or access, but rather the system's ability to properly manage HR data. I've ruled out the other options because they don't seem applicable.\n\n\n"
