Analyzing the ticket text, \"submit your time cards for approval,\" along with \"keeps\" is leading me to lean towards an \"HR Support\" classification. I'm carefully considering the context to ensure accuracy and avoid any misinterpretations.\n\n\n**Defining Ticket Scope**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on defining the scope of this ticket. After considering the text, I'm confident it aligns with \"HR Support.\" The issue focuses on time card submission, rejections, and system errors encountered during this process. This aligns more closely with HR-related processes than other categories. I am analyzing the issues to make sure I am fully accurate.\n\n\n**Identifying Root Cause**\n\nThe ticket analysis leads me to firmly classify this as an \"HR Support\" issue. The primary concern revolves around time card submissions, rejections, and system errors encountered during this process. The provided text details issues with time card submissions, rejections, system errors, and instructions for resolving these issues. Based on the issues, HR Support is the most appropriate category, and the recurring nature of the issue suggests an underlying problem with the time card system that needs to be addressed.\n\n\n"
