After a thorough read, I've honed in on the core problem: an approval bottleneck due to a manager change, which necessitates reassignment within Oracle. This points me towards a specific resolution path.\n\n**Determining Expense Report Category**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the IT ticket details. The core issue revolves around an expense report approval that's stalled due to a manager no longer being employed there, requiring reassignment within Oracle to the current manager. This strongly suggests an HR Support category is most appropriate.\n\n**Resolving Approval Bottleneck**\n\nI've identified the core issue within the expense report ticket: a stalled approval process stemming from a former manager's departure. The required resolution involves reassigning the report to the current manager within Oracle, pointing strongly towards an HR Support categorization.\n\n"
