My analysis so far indicates it's likely related to onboarding a new employee. I'm leaning toward either \"HR Support\" or potentially \"Access\" as the most relevant categories, but need further evidence to be definitive.\n\n\n**Prioritizing HR Focus**\n\nNow, with a more detailed analysis, I've eliminated \"Access\" and narrowed it down even further. My latest thought is that the ticket definitively falls under \"HR Support\". The presence of terms like \"new starter\", \"starter form\", and \"joining contractor\" all strongly point to an HR onboarding process.\n\n\n**Clarifying the Categorization**\n\nMy focus has shifted again to the category, and \"HR Support\" appears the most accurate. Terms like \"new starter,\" \"starter form,\" and \"joining contractor\" consistently point to core HR onboarding duties. The query focuses on the process of onboarding, not specific hardware or account access. While access setup is implied, it's initiated by HR's onboarding workflow.\n\n\n"
