Initial assessment suggests it involves potential network or application issues. While the \"outlook breaks\" part hints at an application problem, the mention of \"switching to cable\" indicates a possible network connectivity issue. My working theory is to investigate if the connectivity issue is causing problems with Outlook specifically. I'm also considering general system troubleshooting, but I'm leaning toward network or application as primary suspects.\n\n\n**Identifying Ticket Category**\n\nI've determined the issue is related to \"Hardware\". The core problem, the \"outlook breaks\" and \"switching to cable\" mentions, strongly suggest a hardware or network connection failure. This points to something physically malfunctioning or misconfigured, rather than, say, an application error. I have ruled out the other categories as irrelevant to the problem description.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Root Cause**\n\nI'm now focusing on a more specific diagnosis within the \"Hardware\" category. It appears the problem might stem from a faulty network cable or port, impacting Outlook's functionality when switched. The fact that Outlook breaks when using the cable strongly suggests it's related to the physical connection or associated hardware and not the Outlook app. I'm prioritizing network hardware troubleshooting to identify the core issue.\n\n\n"
