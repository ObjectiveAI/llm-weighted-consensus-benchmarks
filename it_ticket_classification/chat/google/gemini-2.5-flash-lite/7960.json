After analyzing the provided text (\"new os installation for two macs...\"), I'm leaning towards \"Hardware\" as the most suitable category. It seems to directly relate to installing an operating system, which is a hardware-related task. However, \"Access\" is worth a second glance.\n\n\n**Categorizing the IT Request**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket text, breaking it down to its core: OS installation on two Macs. This solidified my initial assessment: \"Hardware\" remains the best fit. While it could *potentially* be part of an internal project, the request itself is a routine hardware setup task. The other categories don't seem applicable. This decision feels pretty solid now.\n\n\n**Confirming Hardware Focus**\n\nI'm solidifying my initial assessment of this ticket. The core request is clearly the operating system installation, directly linked to computer hardware. Despite the mention of \"traceability reasons,\" which *could* suggest a broader project, the primary action of installing an OS on two Macs places this squarely in the \"Hardware\" category. It's a standard IT support task concerning system setup. The \"hello fresh\" mention doesn't change this classification.\n\n\n"
