Considering \"leavers\" usually signifies departing employees, I'm leaning towards \"HR Support\" or \"Access\", but I'm still weighing the \"infrastructure\" component's implications before making a definitive choice.\n\n\n**Revising Category Choices**\n\nI've refined my initial assessment. While \"HR Support\" and \"Access\" remain strong contenders, \"Administrative Rights\" also warrants consideration as access management is central to leaver processes. I'm leaning heavily towards \"Access\" as the primary category, given its direct relevance to disabling and managing user privileges, but need to consider how \"infrastructure\" may broaden this. The other categories seem less directly applicable, especially given the \"leavers\" focus.\n\n\n**Refining Categorization Decision**\n\nI've been going through more considerations. While \"Access\" remains a strong contender, the overarching scope of \"HR Support\" has become more compelling. Given that \"leavers\" usually requires several steps, the HR support ticket encompasses the end-to-end process including access removal. Infrastructure seems less prominent than the leavers process. The decision seems to be \"HR Support.\"\n\n\n"
