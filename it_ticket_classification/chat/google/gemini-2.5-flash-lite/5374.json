Given the emphasis on \"time cards\" and associated processes, I've determined \"HR Support\" to be the most appropriate classification, aligning with the core function of the request.\n\n**Selecting Category**\n\nI've thoroughly analyzed the provided text, focusing on keywords like \"time cards,\" \"submit,\" and \"rejected.\" My decision leans heavily towards \"HR Support\" as the most accurate classification, given the direct relevance to employee timekeeping processes.\n\n"
