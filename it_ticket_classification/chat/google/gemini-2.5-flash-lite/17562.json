The provided text, \"update project manager pm update hello please update thanks design lead,\" is proving tricky. None of the keywords immediately jump out as a clear fit for any specific category. I'm leaning toward \"Internal Project\" due to the mention of \"project manager\" and \"design lead,\" but I want to be certain before I finalize. I'm still trying to deduce the best fit.\n\n\n**Revising Category Assignment**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket's text, \"update project manager pm update hello please update thanks design lead,\" to refine the categorization. The initial assumption of \"Internal Project\" is still the most compelling fit, given the explicit references to project management and design lead roles. While \"Access\" wasn't completely ruled out, the primary focus appears to be an internal project update. I'm now certain about the \"Internal Project\" categorization.\n\n\n**Determining Project Scope**\n\nI'm now fully confident about categorizing the ticket as \"Internal Project.\" The user's provided text, which includes mentions of \"project manager,\" \"pm,\" and \"design lead,\" combined with the repeated request to \"update,\" clearly points to an internal project-related request. While I initially considered \"Access\" as a possibility, the lack of explicit access-related terms made \"Internal Project\" a more definitive choice. I have finalized my determination.\n\n\n"
