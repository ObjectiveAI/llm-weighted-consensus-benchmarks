Given the content concerning data roaming, billing and settings changes, and caps, \"Hardware\" doesn't seem to fit. \"HR\" is also incorrect. I'm leaning toward creating a new category: \"Network & Connectivity\" or perhaps \"Billing & Services.\" I'll need to confirm what the available categories are or consult with stakeholders for confirmation.\n\n\n**Finalizing Category Selection**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's content, focusing on the core request to enable data roaming and remove caps for work-related travel. Based on the existing schema, \"Access\" emerges as the most suitable category. It aligns with the need to grant or enable access to a communication service. It addresses the issues raised, and it is more specific than other categories such as \"Miscellaneous\".\n\n\n"
