Initial analysis points towards a potential \"HR Support\" issue, given the mention of \"timecard\" submission. However, I need to consider all possibilities before making a definitive classification. I'm carefully reviewing the context to rule out other categories.\n\n\n**Focusing on Category Assignment**\n\nI've been honing in on the correct category. While \"Access\" might seem relevant, the core issue is squarely about timecard submission, approvals, and rejections.  \"HR Support\" aligns perfectly with these processes, making it the most accurate fit.  The validation errors and workflow steps further solidify this designation. I'm now confident that this ticket falls under the \"HR Support\" category.\n\n\n**Clarifying Ticket Classification**\n\nI'm now fully committed to the \"HR Support\" classification. Analyzing the provided text, the problems are centered around timecard submissions, rejections, and approvals. Although access is a small component, the fundamental issue revolves around the inability to submit and receive approval for timecards. This, to me, strongly suggests this ticket belongs in the HR Support category.\n\n\n"
