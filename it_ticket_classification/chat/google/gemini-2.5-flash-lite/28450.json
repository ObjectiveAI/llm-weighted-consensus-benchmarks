While other categories might touch on related aspects, the core issue appears to be directly tied to storage management. I'm double-checking to ensure no other category fits the problem better.\n\n\n**Finalizing Ticket Assignment**\n\nI'm confident in \"Storage\" as the definitive category. My analysis of the ticket's language, with its emphasis on capacity, usage, and availability, leaves no doubt. The keywords strongly support this assignment, and I have carefully reviewed alternative categories to ensure this is the best fit. I'm now ready to provide the categorized ticket.\n\n\n"
