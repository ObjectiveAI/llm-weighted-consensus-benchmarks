The presence of keywords like \"salary\" and \"benefits\" strongly points toward a payroll or compensation-related issue. The mention of \"line manager\" could also indicate a potential access or permissions question within the HR system, but the focus seems to be on financial aspects.\n\n\n**Refining Categorization Strategy**\n\nMy focus has shifted towards differentiating between \"HR Support\" and \"Access\" as potential categories. While \"Access\" could apply, the core issue seems to be salary and benefits inquiry, making \"HR Support\" a better fit. The keywords \"salary\" and \"benefits\" are key indicators. Considering the context, it appears the \"line manager\" role relates to information access.\n\n\n**Pinpointing Ticket Focus**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the best category. The ticket text strongly implies an HR Support need, specifically related to salary and benefits visibility for a line manager. I've ruled out Hardware, Purchase, and Storage due to the content. While \"Access\" could be relevant, the central request concerns salary information, aligning better with HR Support.\n\n\n"
