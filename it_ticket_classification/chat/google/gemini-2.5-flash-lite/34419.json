The \"room finder\" issue, where meeting rooms display incorrect locations and a list view is requested, suggests it might involve administrative rights for configuration or access.\n\n**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm currently analyzing this IT ticket concerning the \"room finder\" feature. The core of the issue seems to be incorrect location data and a user request for a list view. I'm leaning towards \"Administrative rights\" as the most fitting category, as fixing misconfigurations or data within such a system typically requires admin privileges.\n\n**Refining Ticket Classification**\n\nI'm further refining my categorization for this IT ticket. Given the incorrect location data and the request for a list view in the room finder, I'm strongly considering \"Administrative rights\" because updating system data or correcting display logic typically requires such privileges. However, I'm also evaluating if \"Access\" might apply if the user's ability to *see* correct data is restricted.\n\n**Categorizing Ticket Data**\n\nI'm re-evaluating the classification for this \"room finder\" issue. The core problem appears to be inaccurate location data for meeting rooms, which seems to stem from recent additions or updates. My current assessment strongly favors \"Administrative rights\" as the most appropriate category, as correcting such data inaccuracies and potentially adjusting system display logic typically requires elevated privileges. However, I remain open to considering \"Miscellaneous\" if it proves to be a systemic software bug rather than a data configuration error.\n\n**Reviewing Ticket Category**\n\nI'm re-evaluating the best fit for this \"room finder\" issue. The core problem appears to be incorrect location data, possibly after a recent addition. My strong inclination remains with \"Administrative rights\" because correcting such data typically requires elevated privileges. However, I'm also considering if \"Miscellaneous\" is more appropriate if it proves to be a system-wide display bug rather than a data configuration error.\n\n"
