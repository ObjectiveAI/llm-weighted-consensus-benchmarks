The ticket text itself contains phrases that will guide this decision.\n\n**Classifying IT Ticket**\n\nI'm currently analyzing the provided text to determine the most suitable category for an IT ticket. The recurring phrases like \"approve requisition\" and \"raise ticket for issue\" strongly indicate a need to classify this as a \"Purchase\" request, as requisitions are formal requests for procurement.\n\n**Approving Purchase Requisitions**\n\nI've been analyzing the ticket text, and phrases like \"approve requisition\" and \"raise ticket for issue\" are leading me to classify this request under \"Purchase.\" It appears to be a standard procurement process that requires my approval.\n\n"
