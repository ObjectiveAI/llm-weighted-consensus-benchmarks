After careful consideration of keywords like \"add\" and \"members,\" I'm leaning toward \"Access\" as the most appropriate classification. The request seems to involve granting additional permissions to certain individuals. I'm double-checking to ensure this aligns perfectly with the defined categories.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Request**\n\nI'm now carefully re-evaluating the ticket text, considering how the terms \"add\" and \"members\" link to the existing category options. I'm prioritizing \"Access\" because granting access to a resource seems most consistent with the user's request. Additionally, I am ensuring this aligns precisely with our defined category choices.\n\n\n**Confirming Category Choice**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket text with the available categories in mind. \"Adding additional members\" appears to involve access management. Considering all options, \"Access\" still seems most accurate, and I'm confident in classifying the ticket under this category. \"Administrative rights\" is a possibility, but \"Access\" is a more general and fitting classification.\n\n\n"
