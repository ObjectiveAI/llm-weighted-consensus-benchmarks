Based on the ticket's text - mentioning a \"mailbox explode\" and a \"big transaction\" - I'm leaning toward either \"Storage\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" The \"mailbox increase\" request leans toward storage, but the root cause may be complex enough to require a more general category. I'm carefully weighing those options before I finalize the assignment.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Issue**\n\nAnalyzing the ticket text, I've confirmed the primary issue centers on mailbox size and storage. The terms \"mailbox explode\" and \"big transaction\" strongly point towards a storage issue. While temporary, the need for a size increase aligns with the \"Storage\" category. Despite the mention of \"leave,\" the core support request focuses on exceeding storage capacity. This solidifies my assignment of the \"Storage\" category.\n\n\n**Defining the Category**\n\nI've examined the ticket text and determined the user needs a temporary mailbox size increase. The key phrase \"mailbox explode\" and the reason of \"big transaction\" confirm this. Analyzing the given categories, \"Storage\" seems the most fitting. Despite the mention of \"leave\", the main request is a size increase. Therefore, I will categorize this ticket as \"Storage\".\n\n\n"
