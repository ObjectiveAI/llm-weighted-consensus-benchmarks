The initial keywords, \"accessing yammer\" and \"training\", are leading me towards the \"Access\" category, but I need to make sure this is the best fit. I'm considering if there's any implicit information, that would point me in a different direction.\n\n\n**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI've honed in on the ticket's core issue: access. The user explicitly seeks assistance with \"accessing yammer\" and \"training materials.\"  Even the less direct inquiries about \"ingroup type view\" and \"browsing files\" are rooted in access to resources.  The \"Access\" category seems the most appropriate fit. I'm confident in excluding Hardware, HR, Miscellaneous, Storage, and Purchase from consideration.\n\n\n**Revising Category Choice**\n\nAfter reviewing the ticket again, I've confirmed that \"Access\" is still the most fitting category. While the user's questions touch upon training materials and company resources, the core problem is a lack of access. The focus is on *how to* access these items. I am now certain about this.\n\n\n"
