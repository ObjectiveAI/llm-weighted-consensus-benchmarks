After analyzing the description, \"alarm unlocked confirmation signal failed sent tuesday\", and \"alarm unlocked\", I'm leaning towards \"Hardware\" due to the mention of an alarm.  I'm trying to see if there's any other indicator to help narrow down the category.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Issue**\n\nI've refined my initial hardware classification.  The \"alarm unlocked confirmation signal\" points strongly toward a hardware failure within the security system. I'm focusing on the technical malfunction of a physical device.  The \"building regularly unlocked\" aspect seems secondary to the signal problem, further solidifying the hardware focus.\n\n\n**Identifying Specific Failure Point**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the specific type of hardware failure.  The failed \"confirmation signal\" indicates a possible communication breakdown or sensor malfunction within the alarm system. I'm prioritizing the root cause of the signal error, rather than the secondary effect of the building being unlocked.  Waiting for the monitoring center response is also important. The focus is on a hardware component not operating as designed, confirming my initial hardware classification.\n\n\n"
