It's a bit sparse, just \"new visibility hello want,\" but I'm leaning toward \"Access\" or \"Miscellaneous\" as potential fits. The lack of context makes this tricky, but I'm weighing these two categories carefully.\n\n\n**Deciding on Ticket Classification**\n\nThe ticket text, significantly longer now, paints a clearer picture. While \"Miscellaneous\" remains a possibility, the consistent focus on \"site needs accessible,\" \"customers accessing share,\" and \"making content available\" firmly points towards \"Access\" as the most appropriate category. The expanded context solidified this.\n\n\n**Narrowing Category Scope**\n\nI've significantly expanded the ticket text now, and the focus remains access-related. Analyzing phrases like \"site needs accessible\", \"customers accessing share\", and \"making content available\" solidifies \"Access\" as the prime fit. The other categories, like \"Miscellaneous\" and \"Storage\", seem less precise in this expanded context. I'm focusing on the core need of accessibility.\n\n\n"
