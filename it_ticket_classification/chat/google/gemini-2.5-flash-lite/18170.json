After analyzing the available options (\"Hardware|HR Support|Access|Miscellaneous|Storage|Purchase|Internal Project|Administrative rights\"), none seem like a perfect fit, given the lack of context. It's difficult to confidently determine the ticket's nature with such minimal information.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Options**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and key phrases to pinpoint the best category. \"New starter,\" \"joining,\" and \"form completed\" are the standout terms. While \"access\" might be a related need, the ticket focuses on the HR onboarding process itself, not an immediate access request. After reviewing all categories, \"HR Support\" appears the most accurate fit based on the provided text.\n\n\n**Defining the Best Fit**\n\nI'm now fully confident that the ticket belongs in \"HR Support.\" The \"new starter\" context, the \"joining\" reference, and the mention of a \"completed form\" strongly point to an HR onboarding process. Even though there are other related categories like \"Access,\" it's apparent that the emphasis here is on the initial HR steps that lead to access, rather than a direct access request or issue. \"HR Support\" appears the most suitable.\n\n\n"
