The text \"new starter bucharest friday pm thank hi please\" doesn't immediately suggest a clear category. I'm leaning toward \"HR Support\" due to the \"new starter\" phrase, but I need to be certain. Further contextual clues are missing.\n\n\n**Evaluating Categorization Options**\n\nI'm now carefully examining the keywords within the expanded text to refine my initial categorization. After breaking down the user's longer input, terms like \"create ad,\" \"employees added,\" and \"starter forms\" overwhelmingly point towards \"HR Support.\" While \"Access\" could also be considered, \"HR Support\" appears to be the more encompassing category, covering the broader onboarding process that includes access setup. I'm focusing on the procedural elements highlighted by the keywords.\n\n\n**Finalizing Category Selection**\n\nI've carefully considered the user's input, focusing on the keywords that highlight the IT ticket's true purpose. After examining the extended text and the potential categories, I'm confident that \"HR Support\" is the most appropriate choice. Key terms like \"new starter,\" \"create ad,\" and \"employees added\" point to account setup and onboarding, which strongly aligns with the HR function. While \"Access\" is also relevant, \"HR Support\" provides the broader context that better encompasses the entire process.\n\n\n"
