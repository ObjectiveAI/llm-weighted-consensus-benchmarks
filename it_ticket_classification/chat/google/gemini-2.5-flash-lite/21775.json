The ticket text strongly suggests a need to revoke or modify access for a departing employee. The use of \"leaver\" and \"process\" further supports this conclusion. I am confident in this categorization.\n\n\n**Narrowing the Focus**\n\nNow, I'm focusing on \"Access\" as the prime fit. The ticket's emphasis on \"process leaver\" and the nature of an employee's departure point directly to managing access permissions and potentially revoking them. The \"infrastructure\" keyword reinforces this conclusion, since \"infrastructure\" access is what's being managed. I'm leaning heavily towards \"Access\" now.\n\n\n**Prioritizing 'Access'**\n\nThe emphasis on de-provisioning, account removal, and access revocation for the departing employee solidifies \"Access\" as the most suitable category. The ticket's focus on \"process leaver\" and \"infrastructure\" access is crucial, and it clearly points to modifying or terminating access rights as the core issue. I've ruled out other categories as peripheral to the core request.\n\n\n**Refining My Selection**\n\nI'm now fully committed to \"Access\" as the precise category. The ticket's emphasis on revoking or modifying a leaver's permissions aligns perfectly. Thinking further, I see no valid reason to deviate from this choice. All the analysis has pointed firmly to it.\n\n\n"
