So far, the phrase \"annual leave request\" suggests a potential fit within the \"HR Support\" category, but I still need to make sure. I'm carefully reviewing the text for more clues.\n\n\n**Analyzing Ticket Details**\n\nBased on the ticket text, I've concluded the most relevant category is \"HR Support.\" The recurring themes of annual leave requests, booking issues, and withdrawals all point towards an HR-related concern. After evaluating the other options, this clearly aligns best with the content. Now, I'm ready to move on.\n\n\n"
