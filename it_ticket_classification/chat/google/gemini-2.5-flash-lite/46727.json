The repeated errors point me towards \"Access,\" but I'm still weighing if \"HR Support\" has any merit if it's related to the email system. This is a tough one. My thoughts are still evolving, and I'll keep you updated.\n\n\n**Defining the Core Problem**\n\nI've decided to refine the category based on the ticket's core problem: sending emails. My initial leaning toward \"Access\" is still valid, but I'm now leaning heavily towards \"Administrative rights.\" The error messages and permission-denied phrasing push me towards the need for elevated privileges, or a configuration issue controlled by administrative roles. I'm feeling confident in this direction, and I'll keep you posted as I solidify the final choice.\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nMy focus has shifted from \"Access\" to \"Administrative rights\" as the core issue becomes clearer. The error messages strongly point to sending permission issues, likely needing elevated privileges. While \"Access\" is relevant, \"Administrative rights\" is more precise, as this implies a configuration or policy issue controlled by those with elevated permissions. I am leaning towards this now, and the ticket is now classified as an issue regarding administrative rights. I'm aiming for this to be final!\n\n\n"
