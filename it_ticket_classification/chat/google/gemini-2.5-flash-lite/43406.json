It seems the user is specifically seeking a \"hardware data wipe.\" I'm mentally cross-referencing this against the available categories to determine the most fitting match. \"Hardware\" is the strongest contender right now. I'll need to confirm this.\n\n\n**Confirming the Category Match**\n\nI've honed in on the key terms: \"hardware data wipe\" and \"ticket generation bug\". The category seems pretty clearly \"Hardware.\" My main task, I now realize, involves recognizing and classifying these issues accurately. The ticket text's convoluted language, however, does present a slight challenge. I'll focus on how to best clean up this text.\n\n\n"
