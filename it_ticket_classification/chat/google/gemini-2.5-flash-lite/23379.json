I'm considering \"Hardware\" or \"Storage,\" but the lack of specifics makes it difficult. A second pass will be needed to be sure.\n\n\n**Identifying the Root Cause**\n\nThe ticket's text, which highlights an \"Oracle critical issue\" and subsequent \"rejected purchase requisitions,\" leans strongly towards a procurement-based problem. I initially considered other IT categories, however, the direct impact on the purchasing process, and the rejected requisitions, solidify \"Purchase\" as the most relevant classification. I'm focusing more on resolving the current purchase problem.\n\n\n"
