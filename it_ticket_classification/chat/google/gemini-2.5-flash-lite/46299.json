The description, \"submitted time card sent friday november\", presents a challenge. I need to determine the best fit from \"Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, Administrative rights\". My initial thought is it relates to the user's access to a system to update their timecard, but HR is the most appropriate answer. I am leaning toward \"HR Support\" as the appropriate category.\n\n\n**Analyzing Ticket Content**\n\nI've been analyzing the ticket content, and the focus on \"submitted time card\" keeps pointing me towards HR Support. Phrases like \"submit your cards for approval\" and \"status was submitted\" solidify this. While access might be indirectly involved, the core issue seems HR-related, making \"HR Support\" the clear frontrunner. I've ruled out other categories like Hardware, Storage, and Purchase as irrelevant.\n\n\n"
