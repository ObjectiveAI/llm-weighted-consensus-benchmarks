The language is a bit fragmented, but I've identified key terms: \"account,\" \"locked,\" and \"deleted.\" I'm leaning toward \"Access\" as the most likely category, given the account-related keywords, but I need to be certain. I'm carefully weighing the possibility of a \"HR Support\" issue related to account status, but the absence of employee context makes me think access is the better call.\n\n\n**Defining Ticket Scope**\n\nI've determined the scope of the ticket. The phrase \"cannot log in\" is telling. While \"locked\" and \"deleted\" could hint at HR, the core problem is clearly access. I'm confident in categorizing it as \"Access\" based on the provided text, and  I'm ready to move on.\n\n\n"
