The words \"licenses,\" \"virtual machines,\" and \"connect\" suggest a technical issue, but it's not clear. My initial leaning is towards \"Access,\" but I'm hesitant to commit without more information. \"Hardware\" and \"Storage\" seem unlikely based on the provided text. I'm carefully weighing \"Miscellaneous\" as a catch-all if no specific category fits.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Ticket Assignment**\n\nI've determined that the key theme is licensing, stemming from the repeated \"licenses\" and associated phrases. It's a purchase of licenses, confirmed by terms like \"bought by\" and \"costs booked\". While \"connect via solution found\" suggests a technical element, the purchase aspect is dominant. Therefore, I believe \"Purchase\" is the best fit, highlighting that it is about acquiring licenses.\n\n\n**Selecting Proper Category**\n\nI've determined \"Purchase\" is the best fit, highlighting acquisition and financial aspects. While \"connect\" hints at a technical element, the repeated \"licenses\" with \"bought by\" and \"costs booked\" is more dominant, making it a purchase-related issue. \"Access\" or \"Internal Project\" felt less appropriate.\n\n\n"
