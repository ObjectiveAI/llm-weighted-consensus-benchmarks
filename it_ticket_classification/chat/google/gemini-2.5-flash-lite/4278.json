My analysis is leaning towards \"HR Support\" as the most encompassing category for this lifecycle event.\n\n**Refining Ticket Categorization**\n\nI've analyzed the provided text, focusing on the key elements of a departing employee, hardware management, and credential handling. My current assessment leans towards \"HR Support\" as the most accurate classification for this IT ticket.\n\n**Analyzing Ticket Content**\n\nI'm currently dissecting the IT ticket's text, specifically focusing on terms like \"leaver,\" \"hardware retrieval,\" and \"credentials.\" My analysis points toward \"HR Support\" as the most accurate classification, given the strong indicators of an employee offboarding scenario.\n\n"
