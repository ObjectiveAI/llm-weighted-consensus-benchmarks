It looks like someone forgot to include something and is now apologizing. I think the key here is to determine what the user is requesting about this purchase. My instinct is leaning towards the \"Purchase\" category, but I need to be sure this is a request about a new purchase, and not an administrative issue with a purchase made.\n\n\n**Determining Ticket Focus**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's content, focusing on keywords like \"purchase po,\" \"order,\" and \"receipts.\" While \"intel series\" hints at hardware, the core issue revolves around the purchase itself. After comparing the ticket with the available categories, I'm leaning toward selecting \"Purchase\" as the most appropriate category, given the emphasis on the procurement process.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've been analyzing the ticket's language, with \"purchase po\" and \"receipts\" being the key elements. The mention of \"Intel Series\" led me to consider \"Hardware,\" but the core request seems to be about the purchase itself, encompassing details, orders, and receipts. My focus has been on matching the user's primary concern with an appropriate category.\n\n\n"
