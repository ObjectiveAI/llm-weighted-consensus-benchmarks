Initial analysis suggests the subject matter revolves around document access or sharing, but the lack of clear IT-specific language complicates the process. I'm exploring potential links to HR support, but that might be a dead end. I need to figure out what the \"PM\" is.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Access Issues**\n\nI've honed in on the key issue: the user's inability to access shared files. Keywords like \"unable to files,\" \"files view,\" and \"folder\" solidify this. While HR might be involved in the document content, the technical hurdle is accessing those documents. \"Access\" is looking like the top choice over \"Storage\" because of the explicit problem the user states with access.\n\n\n**Categorizing Access Issues**\n\nI've determined that the primary issue is the user's inability to view shared files, focusing my thoughts on the access aspect. Keywords, like \"unable to files\" and \"files view,\" solidify this. While HR might be involved in the document content, the technical hurdle is accessing them. I considered all the categories and ultimately decided that \"Access\" is the most direct category to describe the issue.\n\n\n"
