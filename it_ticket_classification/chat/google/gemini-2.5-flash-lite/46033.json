The words \"security breach\" and \"data\" are pointing me toward a potential \"Access\" issue. It requires more precise categorization, though.\n\n\n**Clarifying the Root Cause**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the root cause. My previous analysis has solidified the \"Access\" issue as the primary category. The unauthorized data visibility, specifically within the ServiceNow instance and concerning sensitive employee details, underscores the access control problem. The \"security breach\" phrasing further solidifies this, although the breach was quickly contained.\n\n\n**Identifying the Data's Exposure**\n\nI'm now focusing on specific details. My prior assumptions are being confirmed. The unauthorized visibility of sensitive employee data within ServiceNow, due to misconfigured application menus, strongly indicates an access control failure. The \"security breach\" label aligns with the nature of the issue.\n\n\n\n**Finalizing the Categorization**\n\nI've determined that \"Access\" is the most fitting category. This decision is reinforced by the unauthorized visibility of sensitive employee data within the ServiceNow instance and the description of a \"security breach.\"  The misconfigured application menus led to an access control issue, making \"Access\" the central theme. The incident involved the accidental, unauthorized exposure of employee data, which directly relates to who could see or access specific information.\n\n\n"
