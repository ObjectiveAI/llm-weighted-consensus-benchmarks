The phrase \"leaver form for\" strongly suggests a process related to employee departures, which I'm evaluating against the provided categories.\n\n**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm focusing on identifying the primary purpose of these IT tickets. The recurring phrase \"leaver form\" and associated terms like \"leaving date,\" \"ad rights,\" and \"mailbox\" are leading me to consider the \"HR Support\" or \"Access\" categories. I'm further refining this based on the specific actions mentioned in each ticket.\n\n**Reviewing Ticket Keywords**\n\nI'm currently examining the recurring keywords across the provided ticket descriptions. The phrase \"leaver form\" and terms like \"leaving date,\" \"ad rights,\" and \"mailbox\" are strongly indicative of processes related to employee departures and access management.\n\n**Managing User Access**\n\nI've processed the ticket descriptions, and the recurring themes of \"leaver form,\" \"leaving date,\" and related actions like managing \"ad rights,\" \"mailbox,\" and \"profiles\" consistently point towards actions concerning user access management during employee offboarding. Therefore, I've categorized these tickets under **Access**.\n\n"
