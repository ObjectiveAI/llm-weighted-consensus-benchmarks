                    "reasoning": "**Defining IT Ticket Category**\n\nMy current focus is on developing a robust system for accurately categorizing IT tickets based on user-provided text. I've begun to analyze phrases like \"amend template snow friday pm\" to discern the most appropriate category. The goal is to accurately tag tickets, for efficient routing and resolution. This will improve workflow for us. I'm focusing on \"amend\" to start.\n\n\n**Analyzing Ticket Content**\n\nI'm deep in the process of categorizing this IT ticket. After considering the \"amend template\" and \"fills category/sub category\" phrases, I'm leaning toward an \"Internal Project\" category, but I am still evaluating \"Miscellaneous\" due to its ambiguity. I'm moving forward by carefully parsing phrases related to 'template', 'fills', and any keywords related to configuration or process issues, as I refine my logic.\n\n\n**Refining Categorization Strategy**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and I think I've figured out the best fit. After assessing \"amend template\", \"fill sub category\", and other phrases, I'm leaning heavily towards \"Miscellaneous.\" \"Internal Project\" is a possibility, but the primary focus is not a project, but a system configuration issue. The \"template\" fix and automated \"fill\" functionality suggest this. It's an operational issue better classified under \"Miscellaneous\" when considering the limited available categories.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Category Precision**\n\nAfter analyzing the ticket text and available categories, I've decided to refine my logic for even greater accuracy. The core focus is on a functional template/system issue rather than a specific project. Based on the provided categories, \"Miscellaneous\" remains the best fit. I've ruled out all other options.\n\n\n**Selecting Ticket Category**\n\nI've carefully analyzed the text and the available categories. The phrases \"amend template\" and \"fill sub category\" suggest a configuration issue within a system. Although \"Internal Project\" is possible, I feel the more precise choice is \"Miscellaneous\". This is because the context points to a functional issue rather than a specific project. This is the best fit given the limited category options.\n\n\n**Selecting Final Ticket Category**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket text and available categories, weighing the implications of \"Internal Project\" versus \"Miscellaneous.\" While \"Internal Project\" is possible if the request is part of a larger initiative, the ticket's focus on a template's functional issue (\"amend template,\" \"fill sub category\") leans more towards a specific problem requiring immediate attention. Given the limited categories, \"Miscellaneous\" remains the most accurate fit.\n\n\n**Selecting Most Suitable Category**\n\nI'm solidifying my approach and I think I'm ready to make the final call. After reviewing the ticket text which contained phrases about templates and sub-category filling problems, I am sure of my decision. While there's a slight chance that \"Internal Project\" could apply, \"Miscellaneous\" remains the best choice for its broader applicability. It is by far the most accurate category in the context of the available options.\n\n\n"
