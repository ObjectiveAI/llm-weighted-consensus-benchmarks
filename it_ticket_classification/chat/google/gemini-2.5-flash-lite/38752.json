I'm leaning towards \"Hardware\" given the connection and asset descriptions.\n\n**Categorizing Network Issues**\n\nI'm refining the categorization of an IT ticket. It details network and client asset problems, including timeouts and standby connection glitches. While \"Hardware\" initially seemed suitable due to asset and connection descriptions, the mention of \"performance testing\" and \"split load resources\" makes me reconsider \"Internal Project\" as a potential, more specific classification.\n\n**Categorizing Technical Issues**\n\nI'm currently analyzing an IT ticket that describes network connectivity problems, client asset malfunctions, timeouts, and standby issues.
