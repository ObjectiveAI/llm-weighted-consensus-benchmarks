The key terms \"new starter\" and \"candidate accepted job offer\" immediately stand out. My initial focus is to accurately classify this ticket from the available categories: \"Hardware|HR Support|Access|Miscellaneous|Storage|Purchase|Internal Project|Administrative rights\". My primary goal here is to get an accurate classification from those options.\n\n\n**Defining Best Ticket Type**\n\nI'm zeroing in on the best category for this ticket. After considering the text and the available options, I'm leaning toward \"Access.\" The key phrases point toward creating user credentials. While \"HR Support\" seemed relevant, the specific action requested (\"create her credentials\") is an IT task directly related to access provisioning. Therefore, \"Access\" seems the most accurate fit.\n\n\n**Confirming Access Classification**\n\nI'm now fully confident in the \"Access\" classification. The \"create her credentials\" detail is the clincher. Although \"HR Support\" initially seemed applicable due to the new starter context, it's clear the specific action requested is an IT task. The ticket's focus is the technical provisioning of a user account.\n\n\n"
