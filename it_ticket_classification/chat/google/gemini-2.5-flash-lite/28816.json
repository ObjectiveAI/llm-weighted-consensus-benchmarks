I am currently focusing on the initial text provided to determine if there are any specific keywords related to the backup process and the subsequent steps that need to be taken. I am almost ready to choose the most appropriate category.\n\n\n**Analyzing Categories Further**\n\nI've determined \"Storage\" is the most apt category for this IT ticket. After careful analysis, all other categories - Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights - are definitively less relevant. The ticket explicitly deals with failed disks, backups, server arrays, and data recovery, which perfectly aligns with the Storage category.\n\n\n"
