My primary goal is to accurately pinpoint the most relevant category from the defined schema. I'm focusing on key phrases and keywords to ensure accurate classification for the end-user. The schema is my guide, and I'm actively comparing the ticket content to each category.\n\n\n**Defining Main Category**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and schema to find the appropriate category. I am still processing the ticket descriptions but I think the ticket relates to either  \"Internal Project\" or \"HR Support\". The descriptions mainly talk about creation, modification, and user guides which seems to be an \"Internal Project\" but also might related to employee.\n\n\n**Finalizing Project Categorization**\n\nMy focus has shifted towards the specific aspects of \"Internal Project\". I believe this reflects setting up tools, standardizing internal documentation and processes. The ticket description strongly emphasizes process setup, user guides, communication, and workflows. I've ruled out HR Support, even though some aspects touch on users, as the core issue isn't human resources-related. The project context seems clear.\n\n\n**Determining Best Fit**\n\nMy analysis indicates the ticket content aligns best with \"Internal Project\". The detailed examination of keywords and phrases, especially \"templates,\" \"setup,\" and \"communication,\" reinforces this conclusion. The focus on internal processes, documentation, and user interaction strongly supports this categorization.\n\n\n"
