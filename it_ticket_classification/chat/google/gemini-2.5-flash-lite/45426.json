I'm leaning toward \"Hardware,\" \"Storage,\" or possibly \"Internal Project,\" but I'm still analyzing. I'm using the keywords to narrow it down. I need to make a decision quickly.\n\n\n**Finalizing the Classification**\n\nI've reviewed the ticket content again and am now certain \"Hardware\" is the correct categorization. The phrase \"warning host topology change\" in conjunction with the description of cable and port issues solidify this. I've ruled out all other options, like HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights, due to their clear lack of relevance to the reported issue. I can now move on to the next task.\n\n\n"
