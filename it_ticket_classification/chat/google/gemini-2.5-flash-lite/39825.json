The goal is to accurately assign incoming tickets to one of these types. I am analyzing ticket descriptions to identify the most relevant category. My current approach involves keyword extraction and semantic analysis of the ticket's text.\n\n\n**Classifying the Ticket**\n\nI've honed in on the ticket's core issue: a stalled \"line manager change\" within Oracle Fusion. Initial keywords like \"stuck process\" and \"status process\" point towards a workflow snag. While \"digital product strategy\" indicates the requester's department, the HR function is the dominant element. After evaluating the categories, I'm leaning toward \"HR Support\" due to the direct relevance of the described problem. The schema will be used to classify the ticket's category.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Best Fit**\n\nI'm focused on pinpointing the ideal category from the schema based on the \"line manager change\" issue in Oracle Fusion. Analyzing keywords like \"stuck process\" and \"status process\", I've ruled out Hardware, Storage, Purchase, and Administrative rights. While it could be an Internal Project, HR Support feels more precise given the direct nature of the problem and the system being used.\n\n\n"
