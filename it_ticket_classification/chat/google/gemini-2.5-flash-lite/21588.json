I'm focusing on the keywords and their implications.\n\n\n**Narrowing the Categorization**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the text within the IT ticket, specifically focusing on the repeated appearance of purchase-related terms. This has solidified my initial hypothesis that \"Purchase\" is the ideal category. I'm confident my choice is accurate, considering the frequency of \"purchase,\" \"ordered,\" and similar keywords.\n\n\n"
