My goal is to match these keywords against the predefined `category` enum values to accurately classify the ticket.\n\n**Identifying Ticket Categories**\n\nI'm actively sifting through the provided ticket text, zeroing in on crucial keywords like \"leaver,\" \"leave date,\" and \"leaver form.\" My aim is to map these terms to their corresponding `category` enum values, ensuring precise ticket classification.\n\n**Mapping Keywords to Categories**\n\nI'm correlating keywords like \"leaver,\" \"leave date,\" and \"leaver form\" with the \"HR Support\" enum. Simultaneously, terms like \"ad rights\" and \"leaver mailbox\" are being mapped to \"Access.\" My current focus is on refining these associations for optimal ticket classification.\n\n**Refining Category Mappings**\n\nI'm currently focusing on assigning the \"leaver,\" \"leave date,\" and \"leaver form\" keywords to the \"HR Support\" category. In parallel, terms like \"ad rights,\" \"leaver mailbox,\" and \"mailbox receive messages\" are being firmly mapped to the \"Access\" category, with the goal of optimizing ticket classification accuracy.\n\n**Analyzing Leaver Ticket Details**\n\nI'm continuing to refine the keyword mapping, focusing on terms associated with user accounts and system access. The current analysis suggests \"leaver,\" \"leave date,\" and \"leaver form\" point strongly towards HR-related processes, while \"ad rights,\" \"leaver mailbox,\" and \"mailbox receive messages\" are clearly in the \"Access\" domain. My immediate next step is to solidify these associations for accurate ticket classification.\n\n**Focusing on Core Ticket Themes**\n\nI'm currently analyzing the ticket's content to pinpoint the dominant themes. My focus is on how keywords like \"leaver,\" \"leave date,\" and \"leaver form\" interrelate with actions concerning \"ad rights,\" \"leaver mailbox,\" and \"mailbox receive messages\" to accurately assign a category.\n\n**Classifying Leaver Ticket**\n\nI'm focusing on classifying this ticket as \"HR Support.\" The keywords like \"leaver,\" \"leave date,\" and \"leaver form\" strongly indicate an employee departure, which is an HR-driven process. My analysis confirms that the other IT-specific actions described are in direct support of this core HR event.\n\n**Prioritizing HR Support**\n\nI'm focusing on classifying this ticket as \"HR Support.\" The explicit keywords like \"leaver,\" \"leave date,\" and \"leaver form\" firmly establish the context as an employee departure, which is an HR-driven process. My analysis confirms that the associated IT actions are in direct support of this core HR event.\n\n**Categorizing Leaver Ticket**\n\nI'm currently analyzing the ticket's content, focusing on keywords related to employee departure. My goal is to accurately map terms like \"leaver,\" \"leave date,\" and \"leaver form\" to the \"HR Support\" category, reflecting the underlying HR-driven process.\n\n**Prioritizing HR Support**\n\nI'm prioritizing \"HR Support\" as the primary category. The extensive keywords like \"leaver,\" \"leave date,\" and \"leaver form\" firmly establish the context as an employee departure, which is fundamentally an HR-driven process. The IT-specific tasks are ancillary to this core HR event.\n\n**Focusing on Core Ticket Themes**\n\nI'm currently analyzing the ticket's content to pinpoint the dominant themes. My focus is on how keywords like \"leaver,\" \"leave date,\" and \"leaver form\" interrelate with actions concerning \"ad rights,\" \"leaver mailbox,\" and \"mailbox receive messages\" to accurately assign a category.\n\n**Classifying Ticket Content**\n\nI'm focusing on the core context of the ticket. The repeated keywords \"leaver,\" \"leave date,\" and \"leaver form\" strongly indicate an HR-driven employee departure process. This makes \"HR Support\" the most fitting category for this ticket's purpose.\n\n"
