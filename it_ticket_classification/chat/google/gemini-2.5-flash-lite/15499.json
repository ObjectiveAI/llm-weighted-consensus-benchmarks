The goal is to choose the best fit from the provided options: \"Hardware\", \"HR Support\", \"Access\", \"Miscellaneous\", \"Storage\", \"Purchase\", \"Internal Project\", and \"Administrative rights.\" The current text mentions a \"new starter\" and an \"accepted job offer.\" My analysis is zeroing in on which category this information strongly suggests.\n\n\n**Identifying the Core Issue**\n\nI've honed in on the key elements of the IT ticket.  The phrases \"new starter\" and \"accepted job offer\" are central. Onboarding a new employee is the core issue here. This necessitates system access and credentials. While \"Access\" is relevant, \"HR Support\" is the more encompassing choice. It directly addresses the overarching process of onboarding. I've ruled out the other options as they are irrelevant.\n\n\n"
