My goal is to accurately categorize each ticket based on the available options, ensuring efficient routing. Right now I am focusing on identifying the relevant keywords.\n\n\n**Evaluating Category Fit**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the ticket content, focusing on identifying the core request and related keywords. The ticket involves pipeline creation for forecasting and revenue calculation, aligning with \"Internal Project\". I've ruled out \"Hardware\", \"HR Support\", and \"Access\" as they are irrelevant. \"Miscellaneous\" feels too broad. \"Storage\" is not relevant. I am now leaning towards \"Internal Project\" as the most appropriate category, but am still thinking through.\n\n\n**Revising Category Choice**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket's core function, which involves creating a forecasting and revenue calculation \"pipeline.\" While \"Miscellaneous\" remains an option, \"Internal Project\" is a much better fit as it encompasses the development of a specific system or process. I am leaning towards \"Internal Project\" because the ticket involves building something new for an internal purpose, and is not a general \"Miscellaneous\" request.\n\n\n**Determining Ticket Label**\n\nI have carefully assessed the ticket's text, identifying key phrases such as \"pipeline creation,\" \"forecast,\" and \"calculate revenues.\" The focus is clearly on a system or process to automate revenue and forecasting. I have reviewed all the available options, and concluded that \"Internal Project\" is the best fit, as the ticket pertains to developing an internal system to handle these key business functions. This is more appropriate than \"Miscellaneous\", which would only be used if no other category were relevant.\n\n\n"
