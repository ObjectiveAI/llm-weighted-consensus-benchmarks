Based on the short text \"leavers missing time oracle sent tuesday,\" I'm leaning toward \"HR Support\" as the most relevant category. It sounds like an issue related to time tracking for employees who have left the company, potentially within an Oracle system.\n\n\n**Evaluating the Ticket's Focus**\n\nI'm now focusing on the phrase \"report employee\" which reinforces the HR connection. The \"missing time oracle\" aspect suggests a data flow problem tied to employee departures. The recent additions confirm this as a reporting issue around employee data post-departure. I think \"HR Support\" remains the best fit, given the emphasis on employee leavers and their associated records.\n\n\n**Identifying the Root Cause**\n\nI'm now diving deeper into the specifics of the IT ticket. Analyzing the text, I've noted \"leavers,\" \"missing time oracle,\" and \"report employee\" are the recurring themes. The latest additions solidify my initial assessment. It looks like the core issue revolves around generating accurate reports for departing employees within the Oracle system, pointing squarely toward \"HR Support.\"\n\n\n"
