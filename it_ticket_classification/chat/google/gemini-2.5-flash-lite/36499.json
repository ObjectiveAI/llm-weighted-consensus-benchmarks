It appears to focus on issues related to time sheets and line manager changes, with a mention of Oracle. Initial impressions lean towards HR Support due to the time sheet aspect, but the Oracle mention could also suggest an IT system related issue. I'll need to weigh these factors to pinpoint the most appropriate category.\n\n\n**Determining the Ticket Type**\n\nI've carefully re-examined the ticket content. The core issues are indeed centered on time sheet problems and challenges with line manager changes. The presence of \"Oracle\" further solidifies the connection to HR systems. Considering the other categories, \"HR Support\" clearly aligns best because it encompasses these aspects of personnel management and the related systems.\n\n\n"
