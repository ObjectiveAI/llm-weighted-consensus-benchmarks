The user's mention of \"connect outside\" immediately suggests an access issue. However, the mention of \"issues issues\" makes me want to look deeper. I'm carefully evaluating the vocabulary to make a final determination.\n\n\n**Categorizing Access Issues**\n\nI've determined that the \"Access\" category is the most appropriate. The user's description, \"having some issues when try connect outside,\" strongly suggests a problem with external network connectivity or resource access. While the initial \"issues issues\" phrase is ambiguous, the detailed explanation, especially the phrase \"connect outside\", leads me to believe the issue is primarily one of access, not a more general IT problem. I've ruled out all the other categories for now.\n\n\n**Confirming Category Choice**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket details, particularly the user's specific phrase \"connect outside.\" My analysis confirms that \"Access\" remains the most appropriate category. Considering all the options, \"connect outside\" points definitively towards an issue of network connectivity or resource access from an external location, and I have arrived at the JSON output required. I'm now ready to render that output.\n\n\n"
