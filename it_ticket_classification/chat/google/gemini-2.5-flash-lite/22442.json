                    "reasoning": "**Analyzing Ticket Text**\n\nI'm currently dissecting the ticket text \"add site to friday\" to accurately categorize it. I'm focusing on identifying keywords and phrases that will point to the most relevant category from the options: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Ticket**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the best category for this ticket based on the provided text. The phrase \"add site\" reappears, indicating a new location or resource. It also includes workflow terms like \"queue\" and \"assign,\" suggesting IT management. Further, terms like \"pitched optimize ext over ports\" and \"approve change networking\" point towards networking or hardware. I'm leaning towards \"Hardware\" or potentially a network related subcategory for this.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Best Fit**\n\nI'm now focusing on whether the ticket relates to Hardware, Access, or potentially a specialized Network category. The repeated \"add site\" could suggest network expansion. Technical terms like \"optimize ext over ports\" and \"approve change networking\" solidify the network focus. \"Assign queue\" might indicate workflow related to network configuration. I'm leaning heavily towards a network-related task, potentially a subcategory of \"Hardware\" or a distinct \"Networking\" option if available.\n\n\n**Determining Final Category**\n\nI'm now grappling with the best fit for this ticket. While \"Internal Project\" is plausible due to \"add site\" and \"community builder,\" the core technical aspects like \"optimize ext over ports\" and \"approve change networking\" lean toward a more specific \"Network Configuration\" or \"Infrastructure\" focus. Since no dedicated network category exists, I'm leaning toward classifying this ticket as \"Hardware\", under the assumption network-related changes fall under the \"Hardware\" domain for this system.\n\n\n**Determining the Best Category**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and am leaning towards \"Internal Project\" as the best fit. While there are strong indicators for \"Networking\" or \"Infrastructure,\" those aren't available categories. The phrases \"community builder\" and \"approve change networking\" suggest a planned development or enhancement, aligning better with a project context.  The \"add site\" aspect could relate to expanding or enhancing an existing internal project. \"Miscellaneous\" remains a fallback if a clearer category isn't justifiable.\n\n\n**Deciding the Final Fit**\n\nI'm now wrestling with the best categorization. While \"Internal Project\" is still a contender due to the \"add site\" and potential for a larger initiative, the core technical networking aspects, such as \"optimize ext over ports\" and \"approve change networking,\" suggest a distinct, hardware-adjacent focus. Since no explicit \"Network\" or \"Infrastructure\" category exists, I'm leaning toward classifying this as \"Hardware\", assuming network-related changes fall under that umbrella for this ticketing system. It reflects the technical nature of the task.\n\n\n**Choosing the Final Fit**\n\nI'm now fully committed to \"Internal Project.\" While the text clearly points to network-related work, the best available fit is \"Internal Project.\" The technical details suggest a planned undertaking. It isn't a simple access request, a hardware repair, or an HR issue. The \"approve change networking\" aspect confirms this is a planned development or system enhancement, fitting the project scope. \n\n\n"
