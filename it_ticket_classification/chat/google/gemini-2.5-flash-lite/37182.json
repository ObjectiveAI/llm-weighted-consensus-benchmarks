The text indicates problems with editing and changing information, pointing towards potential permission or access control problems. I'll need to confirm that this is not a general editing tool issue, but the initial read is leading me towards \"Access\". I am planning on using the phrases such as \"cannot edit\" and \"cannot change\" as keywords to narrow down.\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nI've narrowed the focus, strengthening the case for \"Administrative rights\". The phrases \"cannot edit\" and \"cannot change\" are consistently pointing toward permission-based restrictions. \"Access\" is still relevant, but the lack of administrative privileges seems to be the core issue. I'm prioritizing \"Administrative rights\" based on this more in-depth analysis of the text.\n\n\n**Defining Root Cause Analysis**\n\nI'm now prioritizing \"Administrative rights\" as the most probable root cause, based on a meticulous keyword analysis. The phrases \"cannot edit,\" \"cannot change,\" and similar terms point consistently towards permission-based restrictions. Access is still relevant, but the lack of administrative privileges has emerged as the core issue, confirmed by the phrase \"cannot edit the changes oracle\", which implicates restricted database modifications.\n\n\n"
