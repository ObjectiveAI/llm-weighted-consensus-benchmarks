After analyzing the text, I'm leaning towards \"HR Support\" as the most appropriate category. The phrases \"closure surveys\" suggest an employee feedback process, typically handled by HR. I'm double-checking to ensure there isn't a better fit, but \"HR Support\" appears most relevant.\n\n\n**Analyzing Ticket Categorization**\n\nI've determined that \"Internal Project\" is the best fit for this IT ticket. The focus on modifying survey systems, boosting response rates, and tracking results all point toward an ongoing operational improvement initiative. While \"Miscellaneous\" was a possibility, \"Internal Project\" offers a more precise description. The ticket clearly doesn't pertain to hardware, HR, access, storage, purchases, or administrative rights.\n\n\n"
