The mention of \"file size\" and \"quota\" makes me lean towards **Storage**, but I'm hesitant because it seems a bit vague. I'm considering other options like \"Miscellaneous,\" but I don't feel sure yet.\n\n\n**Finalizing the Classification**\n\nI've solidified my selection as \"Storage.\" The phrases \"personal share quota\" and frequent mentions of \"file size\" were key. While \"Access\" had merit, the focus is storage capacity, not permission. The other options were easily dismissed. It appears the ticket primarily pertains to disk space and quota management.\n\n\n**Defining the Key Issue**\n\nI'm now completely set on classifying this ticket under \"Storage.\" \"Personal share quota\" clinched it, confirming my initial instinct. While \"Access\" had a brief appeal, the emphasis on space rather than permissions makes Storage the superior choice. I'm certain the main topic is disk space management.\n\n\n"
