                    "reasoning": "**Assessing Ticket Content**\n\nI'm currently focused on the ticket content, specifically phrases like \"leaver form\" and \"contract\". My initial assessment points towards a possible HR Support ticket. The mention of a \"leaver form\" strongly suggests this area. However, the term \"contract\" requires further analysis to ensure this categorization is correct, as it could relate to several areas of the business. I need to consider the context to choose the most fitting category. I will need to consider whether I have enough information to decide.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Focus**\n\nI've been analyzing the text in more depth and believe it's an HR Support ticket with heavy IT involvement. The repeated references to \"leaver\" forms, mailboxes, and account access strongly point to this. While hardware is mentioned, the core issue is processing the departure of an employee/contractor.\n\n\n**Categorizing Ticket: Final Decision**\n\nI've finished the deep dive on this ticket. Despite the strong IT elements around access and storage, the root of the issue lies in processing the departure of a contractor, indicated by the \"leaver form.\" This strongly suggests an HR-initiated action, which involves IT components, but is centered on HR needs. The ticket's core theme is managing a \"leaver form\" as part of the employee lifecycle. Thus, \"HR Support\" is the best fit category.\n\n\n**Deciding the Ticket's Category**\n\nI'm now certain that \"HR Support\" is the correct category, with strong connections to \"Access\" and \"Storage\". The \"leaver form\" acts as the central point. I've ruled out \"Hardware,\" \"Purchase,\" and \"Internal Project,\" as they're secondary. IT actions are *support* for HR-driven processes.\n\n\n**Determining Ticket Origin**\n\nI'm zeroing in on the true origin of this ticket. \"Leaver form\" keeps surfacing as the primary driver. It suggests this is an HR request for IT assistance, not the other way around. The IT tasks are in service of the HR leaver process.\n\n\n"
