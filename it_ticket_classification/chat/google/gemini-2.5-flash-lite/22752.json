I'm examining keywords like \"purchase,\" \"device,\" and \"subscription\" to understand the core issue. My goal is to determine the most relevant category within the IT ticket schema. I'm analyzing the provided description to extract these crucial elements and ensure a precise categorization.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've been analyzing the ticket description, focusing on keywords like \"purchase\" and \"device\". I've determined the primary action is a new purchase of a mobile device. The ticket also involves device installation. My current assessment is that the \"Purchase\" category best encompasses the issue, with \"Hardware\" also being relevant. I'm prioritizing the category that represents the core transaction.\n\n\n**Prioritizing the Core Action**\n\nI'm now focusing on categorizing the ticket with the description. I've analyzed \"purchase\", \"device\", and \"installing\". The core issue centers on a device *purchase*, evident in \"new purchase\" and \"purchased\". The hardware aspect is a secondary consequence of the purchase. While the ticket involves device installation, that action is a result of the procurement. I'll categorize it as \"Purchase\".\n\n\n"
