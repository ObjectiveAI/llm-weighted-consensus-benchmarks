My focus is on identifying keywords and context clues within the message. I'm leaning towards HR Support given the mention of a \"contract ended today\" and \"leaver form.\"\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nI've refined my understanding of the IT ticket's core issue. While hardware is mentioned, the central theme revolves around employee offboarding, making \"HR Support\" the most accurate categorization. I'm confirming this aligns with the process flows for employee departures.\n\n**Finalizing Category Assignment**\n\nI've thoroughly reviewed the ticket's content, and the primary focus is undeniably on employee offboarding due to a contract ending and the distribution of a leaver form. This aligns perfectly with HR Support processes, despite the mention of hardware return.\n\n"
