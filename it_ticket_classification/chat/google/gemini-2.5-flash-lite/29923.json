Analyzing phrases like \"non compliant assets\" and \"compliant assets,\" I'm leaning heavily towards a \"Hardware\" or potentially \"Access\" related category. I am working to narrow down the category now.\n\n\n**Confirming Storage Category**\n\nI've re-evaluated the ticket text and the phrases lead me to confirm the \"Storage\" category as the most accurate fit. The repeated mention of \"compliant partition\" and \"unable find compatible\" strongly suggests a disk space or partition configuration issue. The phrase \"non compliant assets\" could be a related factor, but the core technical problem seems to be with storage.\n\n\n**Evaluating Ticket Details**\n\nAfter analyzing the ticket text and initial category selection, I've considered that the phrases \"compliant partition\" and \"unable find compatible\" are highly indicative of a storage-related issue, further confirming this as the most suitable category. The initial considerations of \"Hardware\" and \"Access\" have been downgraded in priority as they do not directly encompass the core technical problem.\n\n\n"
