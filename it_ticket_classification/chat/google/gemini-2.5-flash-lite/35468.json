My goal is to determine the most relevant category based on these keywords. Right now, I believe this ticket aligns with the \"HR Support\" category, given the nature of the request. I'm carefully considering how to refine the keyword matching to ensure accurate categorization across diverse ticket content.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've examined the ticket content closely and identified key phrases related to employee leave management. \"Annual leave,\" \"vacation days,\" and related terms strongly suggest an HR-related issue. Based on this, I'm confident in categorizing the ticket under \"HR Support.\" I'll now explore how to generalize this logic for a broader range of similar tickets.\n\n\n"
