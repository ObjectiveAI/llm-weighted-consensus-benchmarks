This isn't immediately obvious which of the choices this falls into. I'm leaning toward \"HR Support\" due to the nature of \"leaver forms\", but it's not a clear-cut association yet.\n\n\n**Defining the Ticket Type**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on \"HR Support\" as the primary category. The \"leaver form\" is the central element, strongly implying an offboarding process. While \"disable\" points towards access, the context of the entire message, alongside the form, is about the employee leaving, making \"HR Support\" the best fit. I've also considered access, it is less direct, but a secondary consideration.\n\n\n**Finalizing Ticket Assignment**\n\nI've solidified my assignment to \"HR Support.\" While \"disable\" hinted at access, the overarching theme of the \"leaver form\" makes this HR's domain, with IT likely supporting. It's clear the ticket is about offboarding and its associated HR procedures. I've ruled out the other possibilities as irrelevant to the core issue.\n\n\n"
