Other clues like editing files point towards permissions, too. I'm leaning heavily towards \"Access,\" but need to ensure it isn't an HR issue.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down Categories**\n\nOkay, I've refined my thinking on the ticket categorization. Based on \"access required\" and file editing, I'm now leaning definitively towards \"Access\". The phrase \"administrative rights\" seems too specific. \"Master information view\" also points towards needing access to files, not outright administrative control. I've ruled out other categories like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and \"Storage\" because they just don't fit. \"Access\" is the winner.\n\n\n**Refining the Choice**\n\nI've been going over the ticket text again, and \"Access\" really is the standout. Keywords like \"access required\" and \"editing files\" seal the deal. While \"Administrative Rights\" crossed my mind, the need for \"master information view\" and the \"daily job\" context make \"Access\" a more perfect fit. Plus, the other options are clearly not applicable. This is what it comes down to: file access.\n\n\n"
