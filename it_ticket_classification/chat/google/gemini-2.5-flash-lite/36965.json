The primary focus appears to be mailbox capacity. I'm leaning toward categorizing it as \"Storage\" because the user specifically asks to increase mailbox memory, implying a storage concern. However, I'm considering \"Miscellaneous\" if no other category fits the ticket precisely.\n\n\n**Clarifying the Core Issue**\n\nI've been drilling down on the ticket details, particularly the user's explicit mentions of \"mailbox,\" \"quota,\" \"memory,\" and \"size.\" It's becoming clearer: the repeated use of \"your mailbox is almost full\" strongly suggests a storage problem. I'm definitively ruling out the less relevant categories. Categorizing it as \"Storage\" aligns best with the user's request to \"increase mailbox memory\" and reduce the mailbox size. I've eliminated alternatives like \"Miscellaneous,\" as it's too broad.\n\n\n"
