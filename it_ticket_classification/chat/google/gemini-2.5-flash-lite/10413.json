Currently, I am leaning towards the \"Access\" category because of the strong emphasis on access cards, but I need to make sure my logic catches similar access-related tickets, to ensure consistently accurate classification.\n\n\n**Determining the Best Fit**\n\nI've determined that \"Access\" is the best category for this ticket based on the dominant theme of \"access cards.\" My analysis honed in on the recurring keyword, \"cards,\" and the associated phrases like \"access cards usage\" and \"assign order cards.\" While \"purchase\" could be a secondary consideration due to card ordering, the core issue of access control clearly points to \"Access\" as the most suitable category for this ticket.\n\n\n"
