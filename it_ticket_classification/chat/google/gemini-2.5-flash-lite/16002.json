I've identified several key terms, like \"allocation\" and \"purchase,\" which will guide the categorization. Now I'm working to refine the mapping logic to ensure accuracy, especially considering variations in wording like \"po\" or \"new purchase\".\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Ticket Focus**\n\nI've been analyzing the provided keywords from the IT ticket to pinpoint the primary focus. Terms like \"allocation,\" \"new purchase,\" and \"PO\" clearly indicate a purchase-related request. I'm now fine-tuning the classification strategy to ensure accuracy, considering variations like \"po dear purchased.\" I'm confident that the ticket falls under the \"Purchase\" category, given the strong presence of purchasing-related terminology.\n\n\n**Assigning Ticket to Category**\n\nI've been analyzing the new keywords to refine the ticket categorization. Terms like \"mandatory receipts\" and \"compliance,\" when combined with others like \"new purchase\" and \"PO,\" further solidify the \"Purchase\" designation. I've noted \"video explorer\" as an outlier but see no reason to change my assessment that the ticket should be categorized as \"Purchase\". I'm now testing the categorization system with the expanded keyword list.\n\n\n"
