                    "reasoning": "**Identifying the Ticket Type**\n\nI'm currently trying to pinpoint the right category for this IT ticket. Given the terms \"leaver,\" \"form,\" and \"leave,\" I'm leaning toward an \"HR Support\" classification, as these terms typically pertain to employee departures. However, the lack of more specific IT-related keywords makes me hesitant.\n\n\n**Defining the Core Issue**\n\nI've carefully dissected the ticket text, highlighting key phrases related to employee termination. \"Leaver AD,\" \"leaver form,\" and associated terms point towards an \"HR Support\" issue, potentially requiring IT access revocation. The repeated \"did leaver\" prompts further confirm this.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Access Management**\n\nMy focus has shifted to the \"Access\" category, understanding that revoking and transferring access is central to this IT ticket. The keywords clearly indicate a leaver's accounts and rights require modification. I'm prioritizing this as the primary classification.\n\n\n**Finalizing Ticket Classification**\n\nHaving further scrutinized the ticket details, I'm now leaning towards \"Access\" as the most suitable category. Although triggered by an HR event (\"leaver\"), the core IT actions involve managing and modifying the user's access rights and associated resources. Revoking access to the AD, mailbox, and other applications constitutes the primary task at hand. Therefore, the \"Access\" classification more accurately reflects the actual work required.\n\n\n**Defining Access Requirements**\n\nI've further analyzed the ticket, recognizing that while the trigger is HR-related, the core IT task revolves around managing access to various resources. The emphasis on \"leaver AD,\" \"mailbox,\" and \"token\" strongly indicates that the primary function is \"Access\" management, not general \"HR Support\". The phrase \"IT work\" also clearly supports this.\n\n\n**Refining the Classification**\n\nI'm now focusing on the core IT action. While the \"leaver\" context points to HR's initiation, the ticket's IT-specific actions revolve around access management. Revoking AD rights, mailbox access, and other resources aligns directly with the \"Access\" category. The various \"leaver\" mentions trigger this process.\n\n\n"
