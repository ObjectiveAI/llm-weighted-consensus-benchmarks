I'm leaning toward \"Hardware\" at the moment, but still evaluating all options carefully to provide the most precise categorization.\n\n\n**Revising Category Choices**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket description, focusing on the core issues. While initially leaning towards \"Hardware,\" the mobility concerns and presentation limitations caused by the current setup now present a nuanced challenge. The \"changing to laptop\" phrase and \"equipment\" strongly point to Hardware. However, it is an issue surrounding the use of a laptop that is related to mobility. \"Access\" is less applicable. I think \"Hardware\" is still the best option.\n\n\n**Determining Hardware Category**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's language, zeroing in on key terms. The phrase \"changing to laptop\" combined with \"issues equipment\" and mobility concerns, confirms my initial assessment. Despite the complexity around presentation, the root problem boils down to hardware suitability for the user's requirements. Thus, after a thorough review, my conclusion is still \"Hardware\".\n\n\n"
