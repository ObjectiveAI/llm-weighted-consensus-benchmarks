The ticket mentions needing \"new instances\" with a \"same configuration\" for an existing user. My initial assessment points towards the \"Internal Project\" category due to the focus on instances and configurations, though I'm keeping \"Miscellaneous\" as a fallback.\n\n**Refining Ticket Categorization**\n\nI'm currently re-evaluating the IT ticket based on the mention of \"new instances\" and \"same configuration.\" While \"Internal Project\" remains a strong contender due to the implication of setup and repeatable environments, I'm also considering \"Miscellaneous\" if the context is too general to fit a defined project.\n\n**Refining IT Ticket Classification**\n\nI'm continuing to refine the categorization of the IT ticket. The mention of \"new instances\" with a \"same configuration\" strongly suggests the provisioning of environments, likely for development or operational needs. While \"Internal Project\" remains a primary consideration due to the implications of repeatable setups and the \"agile\" keyword, I'm also weighing \"Miscellaneous\" if the request lacks clear project-specific context.\n\n**Refining Ticket Classification**\n\nI'm continuing to refine the categorization of the IT ticket.
