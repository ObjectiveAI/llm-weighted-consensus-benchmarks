Right now, I'm analyzing the provided ticket, which mentions a public holiday display issue and Oracle. I'm leaning toward \"HR Support\" due to the holiday issue, but the Oracle mention adds complexity. I'm still trying to figure out if it is an access issue related to the internal database or something else. I might need to consider multiple tags to categorize this particular ticket.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the ticket content, and the focus is clearly on public holiday display and timecard issues within a system. My thinking has shifted firmly towards \"HR Support\" as the primary category. The Oracle mention still has me wondering, but it seems to be related to the underlying system used for timekeeping or HR functions, rather than a direct Oracle database access problem. I'm confident that the core of this ticket revolves around HR-related system functionality.\n\n\n**Refining Category Selection**\n\nMy focus has sharpened to \"HR Support\" as the definitive category. Analyzing the ticket details, the central issue revolves around public holiday display errors and their ripple effects on timecard and leave entries. I've ruled out other categories like \"Access,\" \"Hardware,\" and \"Storage,\" as the problem doesn't involve access permissions, hardware failure, or data storage. Considering the employee's request for rectification related to time-off and pay, HR support is the only appropriate selection.\n\n\n"
