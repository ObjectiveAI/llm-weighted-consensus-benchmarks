My approach involves a close examination of the text, aiming to extract the core issue and map it to one of the defined categories. I'm prioritizing accuracy to ensure the generated JSON object reflects the true nature of the ticket. The JSON format is central to my strategy, as it must perfectly mirror the provided schema.\n\n\n**Refining Category Assignment**\n\nI've honed in on the \"Hardware\" category as the most appropriate. The ticket's text, describing the need to \"restart the controller,\" strongly points to a hardware-related issue.  I've systematically eliminated other categories, weighing them against the specific details. The process now centers on ensuring the JSON output accurately reflects this decision.\n\n\n"
