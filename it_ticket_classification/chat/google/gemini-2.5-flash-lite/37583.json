It appears they are primarily seeking access to transaction reports. Multiple phrases confirm this, highlighting requests for permissions and rights related to viewing these specific reports.\n\n**Confirming Ticket Classification**\n\nI've analyzed the ticket text and am confident in categorizing it under \"Access.\" The persistent mentions of \"request access,\" \"access for,\" and \"rights\" for \"full transaction reports\" solidify this classification.\n\n"
