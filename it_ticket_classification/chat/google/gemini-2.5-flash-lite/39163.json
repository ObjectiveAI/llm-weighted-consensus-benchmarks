I'm leaning towards \"Storage\" as the primary category, but I'm keeping \"Access\" in mind as a secondary possibility related to mailbox size limitations. I'm exploring the nuances to ensure the most accurate categorization for efficient resolution.\n\n\n**Refining Categorization Focus**\n\nThe ticket's narrative highlights multiple access-related problems. \"Cannot open mailbox\" and recurring \"access card leaver\" references indicate permission conflicts. The \"full mailbox\" issue is a symptom, not the root cause. I'm prioritizing \"Access\" now and reassessing the \"Storage\" component as secondary. The focus is to determine the underlying access permissions or configuration.\n\n\n**Defining Access Priority**\n\nI've been analyzing the \"access card leaver\" references and \"cannot open mailbox\" errors. These point to access permission problems, potentially stemming from an employee offboarding procedure. I'm now certain that \"Access\" is the primary category. While \"mailbox full\" hints at storage, it's a symptom, not the core problem. The root cause appears to be the inability to access or manage the mailbox due to access-related issues. I'm focusing on defining the precise nature of these access permission problems, as there are many possible causes.\n\n\n**Defining the Root Cause**\n\nThe ticket's text, \"cannot open mailbox\" and repeated \"access card leaver\" references, clearly indicate a primary \"Access\" problem. I'm prioritizing this categorization based on the employee offboarding context and email access difficulties. The mailbox full issue, though a relevant detail, seems secondary and likely a consequence of the access problem. I'm focusing on pinpointing the specific access permissions failing in this scenario.\n\n\n"
