The description indicates a potential Trojan infection from a website, suggesting a security issue that doesn't neatly fit hardware, HR, or access. Therefore, I'm leaning towards \"Miscellaneous\" as the best fit for this type of malware report.\n\n**Resolving the IT Ticket Category**\n\nI'm in the process of assigning a category to the IT ticket. Given the details about a suspected Trojan infection originating from a website and the request for computer cleanup, I've determined it doesn't align with Hardware, HR, Access, or other specialized areas. Therefore, I've classified it under \"Miscellaneous\" as the most fitting option for this type of security-related incident.\n\n**Assigning Ticket Category**\n\nI'm finalizing the categorization of the IT ticket. Based on the user's report of a Trojan infection from a website and their request for computer cleaning, and considering the available options, \"Miscellaneous\" remains the most suitable classification. It best encompasses this type of security-related incident when a more specific category isn't present.\n\n"
