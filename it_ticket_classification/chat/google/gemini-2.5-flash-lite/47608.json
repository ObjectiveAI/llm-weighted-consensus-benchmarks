Considering the provided category list, I am leaning toward HR Support, which is the most relevant.\n\n\n**Revising Category Choice**\n\nNow, I'm re-evaluating the category selection based on the ticket content. The recent focus is on the recurring phrases indicating departures. Considering the options, \"HR Support\" remains the strongest fit due to the explicit mention of \"leaving\" and \"exit,\" strongly suggesting employee-related processes. The mailbox issue feels secondary to the central theme.\n\n\n"
