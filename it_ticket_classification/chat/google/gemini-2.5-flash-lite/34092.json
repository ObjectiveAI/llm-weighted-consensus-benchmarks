I've read the provided text and am leaning towards \"Miscellaneous\" or possibly \"Access\" given the mention of file uploading and ticket management. I'm focusing on the keywords and the overall context to make the right call.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Options**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and I think the issue is narrowed down to either \"Access\" or \"Storage.\" The keywords \"error uploading files\" and \"trying upload file\" are central. Although \"Access\" could be a factor, it feels more like a storage issue. The user is experiencing a direct problem with file uploading, which suggests a lack of, or a problem with, storage.\n\n\n**Focusing on \"Storage\"**\n\nI'm now very certain that \"Storage\" is the best choice for this ticket. The words \"error uploading files\" and \"trying upload file\" are central to the issue. The keywords make the connection to storage obvious and the ticket appears to describe a system level issue, likely due to a lack of storage space or permission.\n\n\n"
