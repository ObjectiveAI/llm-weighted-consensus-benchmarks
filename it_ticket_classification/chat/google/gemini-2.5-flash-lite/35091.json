The focus on \"reports\" and the inability to open them points away from hardware or HR issues. Access seems unlikely, and it's not a clear purchase or administrative rights matter. The issue appears to be more related to data access or a system failure impacting document retrieval.\n\n\n**Determining Ticket Priority**\n\nI'm now prioritizing the ticket based on the \"Access\" categorization. It's becoming evident the user needs access to essential reports, so this warrants prompt attention. I am now considering the potential impact on the user's work and the broader organization. The inability to access reports is probably hindering their ability to perform their duties. This suggests that the issue is not just a minor inconvenience but may require rapid intervention. My focus is quickly transitioning from analyzing the category to implementing a suitable solution.\n\n\n**Defining Access Issue Type**\n\nI'm zeroing in on defining the exact nature of this \"Access\" issue. Considering the problem, I'm leaning toward a permissions or system failure impacting report accessibility, rather than a general access problem. My current thought process is to categorize the issue within the Access group. This ticket isn't only about a generic access problem. It's more about report access specifically. Further analysis into whether it is a configuration issue or user rights issue will happen next.\n\n\n"
