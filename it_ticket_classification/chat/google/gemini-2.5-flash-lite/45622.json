The \"task details filter not working\" snippet suggests a potential technical issue, but it's unclear without more context. Considering the limited data, I'm leaning toward \"Miscellaneous\" as a catch-all for now, but I'll need more information to be certain.\n\n\n**Analyzing Filtering Malfunction**\n\nI've taken a deep dive into the user's issue with the \"task details\" filter in Fusion. This isn't a straightforward hardware or HR problem. After eliminating the other options, and with the limited information, \"Miscellaneous\" continues to seem like the best initial bet. However, I am now considering a potential shift toward \"Internal Project,\" given the possibility this filter is specific to an in-house application, but more details about the system context are really needed.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Software Functionality**\n\nI'm now focusing on the \"fusion\" application and its non-functional filter. The user's description points to a software-specific issue rather than hardware or HR-related problems. My analysis shows this doesn't neatly align with our existing categories, pushing me towards \"Miscellaneous\" as the likely home for this issue. More context, however, could shift me. I'm focusing on the user being unable to perform a specific function within the application.\n\n\n"
