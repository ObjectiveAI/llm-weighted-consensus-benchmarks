Considering the mention of \"oracle rejected\" and \"approval flow,\" I'm leaning towards \"Access\" as the most appropriate classification, as it implies a workflow rejection within a system, rather than a hardware issue.\n\n**Classifying Rejection Details**\n\nI've analyzed the provided ticket snippet, noting keywords like \"oracle rejected,\" \"approval flow,\" and \"rejection.\" This strongly suggests the issue is related to a denied request within a system process, leading me to classify it under \"Access\" as it pertains to system workflows and permissions.\n\n**Classifying Ticket Reason**\n\nI'm processing the IT ticket, focusing on the \"oracle rejected\" and \"approval flow\" elements. I'm leaning towards classifying this under \"Access\" as it most closely describes a denied workflow for system permissions or data access.\n\n**Refining Ticket Classification**\n\nI'm continuing to analyze the IT ticket details. Given the recurring emphasis on \"approval flow\" and \"rejection\" in conjunction with \"oracle,\" I'm solidifying my assessment. The most fitting category remains \"Access,\" as it accurately encapsulates the nature of a denied workflow potentially related to system permissions or resource allocation within the Oracle environment.\n\n**Classifying Rejection Details**\n\nI've analyzed the provided ticket snippet, noting keywords like \"oracle rejected,\" \"approval flow,\" and \"rejection.\" This strongly suggests the issue is related to a denied request within a system process, leading me to classify it under \"Access\" as it pertains to system workflows and permissions.\n\n**Classifying Ticket Details**\n\nI'm processing the IT ticket, specifically focusing on the \"oracle rejected\" and \"approval flow\" elements.
