The user seems to be experiencing upload difficulties across multiple browsers after attempting common troubleshooting steps. While the description is somewhat fragmented, the core issue appears to be related to file uploads and, potentially, network access or a software issue. This points towards a category related to access or storage.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Culprit**\n\nI've been analyzing the user's fragmented ticket regarding upload failures. I've ruled out hardware, HR, purchase, and internal project categories. While \"Access\" could be a factor, the issue is with performing an action, and \"Storage\" is also a possibility due to upload failures and recurring problems. My current focus is on determining if the issue is with access to the upload function or an underlying storage constraint.\n\n\n**Clarifying the Issue**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the best fit for this ticket. The user can't upload a file and has tested various methods to resolve this. \"Miscellaneous\" appears to be the most fitting category for the general functional issue, especially given that the user wants to identify a solution. While other categories are possibilities, the ticket seems broad enough that it doesn't clearly fit into something more concrete.\n\n\n"
