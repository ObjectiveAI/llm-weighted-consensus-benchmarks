Currently, I'm working through parsing nuances.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Hardware Detection**\n\nI've determined that the ticket text, describing a \"missing call button,\" strongly indicates a hardware-related issue. My focus is now on confirming that the system accurately identifies this and maps it to the \"Hardware\" category in the JSON output, rather than miscategorizing it as \"miscellaneous\". I am focusing on ensuring that the system is able to properly categorize this based on the physical component, or the function that the hardware performs.\n\n\n**Defining Hardware Categorization**\n\nI've determined that the \"missing call button\" text clearly indicates a hardware issue. I'm focusing on ensuring accurate JSON output, specifically mapping this to the \"Hardware\" category. I am confirming that the system recognizes this as a hardware-related issue and does not categorize it as \"Miscellaneous.\" My rationale centers on the physical component (\"call button\") or the device.\n\n\n"
