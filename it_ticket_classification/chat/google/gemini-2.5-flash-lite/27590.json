The limited information makes it challenging, but I'm leaning towards \"HR Support\" due to the mention of a \"new starter.\" I'm reviewing the other options to ensure this is the most appropriate fit, and will provide an update when confirmed.\n\n\n**Narrowing Ticket Classification**\n\nI've further refined my initial assessment. The phrase \"new starter\" and the mention of an \"administration officer\" solidify my choice of \"HR Support\" for the ticket's classification. While other categories might touch on aspects of the new hire process, the core of the issue presented appears rooted in onboarding or related HR requirements. I'm satisfied this category is the most fitting.\n\n\n**Identifying Final Ticket Category**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket text and the available categories. My analysis emphasizes \"HR Support\" due to the primary indicator, \"new starter,\" and the supplementary detail, \"administration officer.\" While access rights might be relevant, the ticket's core focus seems firmly rooted in the initial onboarding phase, best captured by the \"HR Support\" classification. I'm ready to finalize this categorization.\n\n\n"
