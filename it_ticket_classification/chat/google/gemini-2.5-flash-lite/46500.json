After carefully reading, I've concluded that the issue is likely related to the software used for meetings, which isn't explicitly listed in the allowed categories. I'm leaning toward selecting a more general category like \"Miscellaneous\" as a default.\n\n\n**Defining Access Issues**\n\nI've been re-evaluating the ticket content, and after careful consideration, I'm confident that the core issue is indeed an access problem. Although the root cause *might* be software, the immediate problem is the inability to join the meeting due to a broken link. Therefore, I believe categorizing this under \"Access\" is the most accurate approach.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've been meticulously examining the ticket content again. The phrase \"meeting link not working\" jumps out, and it's clear the core problem is lack of access. Despite the underlying software potentially causing the problem, the immediate issue is the inability to connect. \"Access\" is the most precise categorization, even if the root cause is software-related.\n\n\n"
