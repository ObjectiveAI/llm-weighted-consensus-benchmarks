After analyzing the provided text, which mentions \"extension cord,\" \"connect second monitor,\" and \"lack length cable,\" I've narrowed it down to potential fits. I'm leaning toward \"Hardware,\" as the core issue seems related to physical equipment. I'm considering \"Miscellaneous\" as an alternative if no better fit emerges.\n\n\n**Confirming the Hardware Category**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket details, focusing on \"extension cord,\" \"connect second monitor,\" and \"lack of cable length.\" My analysis firmly points to \"Hardware\" as the definitive category. I've considered and rejected other options, such as \"Miscellaneous,\" as the issue directly concerns physical IT equipment. This decision is based on a comprehensive review of all phrases, and comparison to the given categories.\n\n\n"
