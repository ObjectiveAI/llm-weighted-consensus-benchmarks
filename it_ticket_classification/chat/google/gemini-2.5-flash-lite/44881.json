I am looking to solidify the logic for distinguishing between different types of access requests.\n\n**Classifying Tickets by Theme**\n\nI'm continuing to refine my understanding of the IT ticket content, and the recurring themes of maternity leave returns and access-related issues are becoming clearer. My current focus is on how these two aspects interact to determine the most accurate classification.\n\n**Resolving Access Issues**\n\nI'm refining the logic for ticket categorization, specifically focusing on how phrases like \"domain credentials\" and \"accessing\" strongly indicate an \"Access\" issue, even when intertwined with HR-related themes like maternity leave returns.\n\n**Addressing HR-Related Access**\n\nI've identified that the core of this ticket revolves around an employee returning from maternity leave. My current focus is on how to best categorize this, prioritizing \"HR Support\" as the primary driver for the access-related tasks mentioned.\n\n**Prioritizing HR Support**\n\nI've identified the primary driver for this IT ticket as an employee returning from maternity leave.
