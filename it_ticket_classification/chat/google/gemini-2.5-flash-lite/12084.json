Currently leaning towards \"HR Support\" due to the mention of \"new starter\" and \"joiners,\" suggesting onboarding activities. Still, the phrase \"colic\" is confusing and could be a typo. I need to ensure a correct categorization.\n\n\n**Categorizing the IT Ticket**\n\nThe ticket's text suggests \"HR Support\" is the most applicable category, despite ambiguous wording. Specifically, the phrases \"new starter\" and \"attaching two joiners\" imply an onboarding request, common in HR. While \"colic\" is confusing, it doesn't outweigh the significance of the other details. My reasoning leans toward HR Support as the primary focus, requiring further clarification to be certain.\n\n\n**Assessing Ticket Details**\n\nI'm now fully immersed in the ticket's specifics. The \"new starter\" and \"joiners\" wording strengthens my initial HR Support categorization. The date/location elements still seem extraneous, and don't change my focus. The mention of \"joiners\" seals the decision.\n\n\n"
