The user's mention of \"viruses\" and \"browsing\" immediately points toward a potential security concern, but I need to make sure I don't overlook any other relevant aspects, like potential hardware malfunction. My goal is to narrow down the categories based on the language used.\n\n\n**Analyzing the Options**\n\nI've re-evaluated the provided categories in light of the ticket's security focus. Initially, \"Miscellaneous\" seemed the closest fit, given the lack of a dedicated \"Security\" category. However, I'm now leaning towards clarifying with the user about a more appropriate category. The evidence strongly suggests a malware infection triggered by web browsing, which doesn't align perfectly with any option provided, but is best fit by the \"Miscellaneous\" option.\n\n\n**Reaching a Conclusion**\n\nI've decided to categorize this ticket as \"Miscellaneous\". While none of the provided options perfectly encapsulate a security concern, this category seems the least inaccurate. The user's description clearly points to a potential virus infection related to web browsing. Given the limited categories, \"Miscellaneous\" is the most fitting choice for this common IT scenario.\n\n\n"
