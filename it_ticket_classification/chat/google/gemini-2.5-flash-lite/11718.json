My initial assessment indicates this points squarely toward either \"Storage\" or \"Access\". I'm leaning heavily towards \"Storage\" since it's about the location and management of files. But, further refinement is necessary to definitively exclude \"Access\".\n\n\n**Analyzing Access Concerns**\n\nI'm now delving into the \"Access\" versus \"Storage\" dilemma. The user's query about shared folders is complex. I'm considering whether it's primarily an access request (permission issues) or a storage issue (folder setup/management). The \"thursday july pm\" time frame makes me lean towards managing the folders' existing state or setting up existing shared folders, which seems more like Storage. The phrasing suggests a focus on the shared folders' function, more than gaining access.\n\n\n**Defining Ticket Classification**\n\nI've clarified the intent behind the ticket's language. The focus on shared folders suggests storage management is the user's need, not simply access granting. \"Thursday July PM\" further solidified this, pointing to a scheduled setup/configuration, not requesting user permissions. I'm confident 'Storage' best reflects the core request.\n\n\n"
