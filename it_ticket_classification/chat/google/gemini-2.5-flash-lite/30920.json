The text details errors in an expense report and mentions policy, per diem, and account concerns. I'm leaning toward either \"HR Support\" or \"Administrative rights\" but will make sure this is the most accurate.\n\n\n**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI've honed in on the HR Support category for this expense report ticket. The user can't submit due to errors, policy checks are needed, and per diem plus accounting are mentioned.  While \"Administrative rights\" was considered, \"HR Support\" feels more directly relevant to the issue of expense report submission itself. I'm now certain this categorization is correct.\n\n\n"
