The phrases \"post upgrade issues\" and \"cannot access\" have led me to consider \"Access\" as a strong contender. The presence of \"errors\" further strengthens this notion, but I'm still weighing it against other possibilities before a final decision.\n\n\n**Confirming Access Category**\n\nI've solidified my choice of \"Access\" as the ticket's category.  The \"cannot access\" and associated login errors, especially following a post-upgrade issue with Oracle Fusion, point definitively to an access-related problem. While related factors like HR and admin rights were briefly considered, \"Access\" best encapsulates the core difficulty the user is facing.\n\n\n"
