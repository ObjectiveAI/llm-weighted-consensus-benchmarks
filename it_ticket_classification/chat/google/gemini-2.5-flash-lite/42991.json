Currently, I am analyzing text from the tickets to find the correct fit. I've narrowed down the current list of categories to 8 options and am actively finding the best fit based on keywords in the text. I think my current strategy will work out.\n\n\n**Determining Ticket's Category**\n\nI'm revisiting the ticket's text, \"problem with the submit sent monday problem with submit hi having small issue with tool submit button visible was regards.\" Despite the jumbled phrasing, \"submit button visible\" strongly suggests a functional problem with a tool. Considering the categories \u2013 Hardware, HR, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Admin Rights \u2013 none perfectly fit, as there isn't a category like \"application functionality\". Thus, \"Miscellaneous\" appears to be the most appropriate choice.\n\n\n**Choosing Ticket's Best Fit**\n\nMy analysis of the ticket's text, \"problem with the submit sent monday problem with submit hi having small issue with tool submit button visible was regards,\" leads me to refine the category determination. While the jumbled phrasing complicates things, the phrase \"submit button visible\" seems central, pointing to a functional problem with an application. Reviewing the available categories\u2014Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights\u2014none precisely match \"application functionality.\" Therefore, I believe \"Miscellaneous\" remains the best fit for this poorly described or general issue.\n\n\n"
