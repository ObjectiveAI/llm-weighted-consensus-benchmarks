The repeated phrase \"cannot connect\" on the client side indicates a potential network or access issue. I'm weighing whether it's related to hardware, access permissions, or perhaps a broader network connectivity problem.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Access Issues**\n\nMy current focus is solidifying the \"Access\" categorization. The evidence clearly points toward authentication and connection troubles. The \"cannot connect\" instances and certificate issues strongly support this. Although there's a connectivity element, the core problem seems to be an inability to authenticate properly, which falls under access. I've ruled out hardware and HR support for now.\n\n\n**Finalizing Access Determination**\n\nI've reviewed the provided ticket text and have finalized my categorization. The issues described, including repeated connection failures, password prompts, and certificate errors, all point directly to an access-related problem. While connectivity is a factor, the underlying issue seems to be an inability to authenticate or establish a secure connection, solidifying my choice of \"Access\" as the primary category for this ticket.\n\n\n"
