The user's issue seems related to booking a meeting room, with a connection problem mentioned. Initial thoughts lean towards \"Access\" or potentially \"Miscellaneous,\" but I need to consider all available options before reaching a definitive conclusion.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Hardware Diagnostics**\n\nI've revised my initial assessment, now leaning strongly toward \"Hardware\" as the primary category. The \"room says connection\" detail is the deciding factor; it points directly to an equipment malfunction within the meeting room, such as a faulty booking terminal or network device. While \"Access\" wasn't completely dismissed, this new information makes \"Hardware\" the most probable cause.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Root**\n\nI've refined my initial assessment, now focusing squarely on the \"Hardware\" category. The phrase \"room says connection\" decisively steered me towards this conclusion. While \"Access\" wasn't entirely dismissed, the specific wording now indicates a physical problem within the room, most likely a faulty terminal or network device. After deeper consideration, I've decided to select \"Hardware\" as the most appropriate category.\n\n\n"
