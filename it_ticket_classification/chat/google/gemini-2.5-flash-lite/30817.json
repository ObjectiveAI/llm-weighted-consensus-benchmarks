My goal is to efficiently and correctly classify each ticket based on its content.\n\n**Refining Ticket Classification**\n\nI'm refining the classification of an IT ticket. Based on keywords like \"oracle role change\" and \"rights granted,\" I'm leaning towards the \"Access\" category as the most appropriate. This seems to better encompass the core request than other options, including \"Administrative rights\" which feels too specific in this context.\n\n**Classifying Ticket Requests**\n\nI'm currently analyzing ticket text to determine the most suitable category. Keywords like \"oracle role change\" and \"rights granted\" strongly point towards \"Access\" as the primary classification, as it most broadly covers modifications to user permissions and system roles.\n\n"
