After reviewing the keywords, it seems the ticket is about copying or creating something. Given the keywords, \"create\", \"clone\" and \"existing board\" I've narrowed it down, and it's starting to point towards a very specific category.\n\n\n**Analyzing the Core Issue**\n\nI'm digging deeper into the ticket text to pinpoint the primary issue. The phrase \"create a clone of existing board\" is the key. The focus is on replicating a \"board,\" suggesting an operation within a project management tool. This points strongly towards an **Internal Project** category. While access may be needed, the core request is a project-related clone.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Project Needs**\n\nI've been honing in on the crucial aspects of this ticket.  I've concluded the main focus is project-related, involving a \"board\" clone, pointing me to the \"Internal Project\" option. While there might be implications for access, the central requirement is performing a cloning action within a project management context. The request is very direct and clear.\n\n\n**Categorizing the IT Request**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the text and the potential categories. The user's request, \"create a clone of existing board,\" heavily suggests project management. While access might be involved, the central focus is on replicating a \"board,\" aligning perfectly with the \"Internal Project\" category. I've ruled out others, such as administrative rights, as the request is to *perform* the clone, and not *gain* the right.\n\n\n"
