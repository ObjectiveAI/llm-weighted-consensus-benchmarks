My initial focus is on the phrase \"meeting room,\" which appears twice. This suggests a potential hardware or access issue. I'm exploring the nuances of \"not working\" and \"already fixed\" to refine the categorization. This is still a preliminary analysis, but I am leaning towards Hardware or Access.\n\n\n**Defining the Ticket's Scope**\n\nI'm now focusing on categorizing the ticket definitively. Based on the text \"meeting room is not working meeting room working already fixed by,\" it's clear the core issue revolves around meeting room equipment. While \"Miscellaneous\" could be an option, the specific nature of the problem strongly suggests a \"Hardware\" issue. I've ruled out HR Support, Access, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights as irrelevant to this particular scenario. My conclusion leans towards classifying the issue as a \"Hardware\" problem, and I am ready to output the appropriate JSON.\n\n\n"
