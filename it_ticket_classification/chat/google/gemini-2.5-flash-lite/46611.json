I am leaning toward a category that encompasses email and search-related problems.\n\n\n**Selecting the Best Fit**\n\nI've decided to classify the ticket as \"Miscellaneous\". While indexing is a functional problem, and could relate to storage in some contexts, the core issue is the search/index functionality within an application - Outlook. The provided categories don't explicitly fit an application-related problem, thus \"Miscellaneous\" is the most encompassing.\n\n\n"
