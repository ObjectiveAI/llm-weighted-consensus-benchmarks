I need to consider if \"change\" relates to access, or could be a personnel matter. The brevity makes it tricky.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Best Fit**\n\nI've analyzed the ticket text: \"people manager change change hello assist her thank administration officer wednesday change hello writing regarding change currently made change which approved changed kind regards developer rd\". The repeated \"change\" and mentions of \"people manager\" and \"administration officer\" solidify the \"HR Support\" category.  \"Assist her\" also suggests support, solidifying my prior conclusion. I'm ready to output the assignment in the required JSON format.\n\n\n"
