Given the details around \"nomination processing,\" \"approval tab,\" a \"blank field\" for a line manager, and a user's departure potentially triggering the issue, \"HR Support\" appears to be the most fitting classification. I'm also considering \"Access\" if the core problem lies in permissions for that specific process.\n\n**Finalizing IT Ticket Classification**\n\nI've finalized the IT ticket's classification. After analyzing the details regarding nomination processing, approval tabs, and user departures impacting line manager fields, \"HR Support\" is the most accurate designation for this issue.\n\n"
