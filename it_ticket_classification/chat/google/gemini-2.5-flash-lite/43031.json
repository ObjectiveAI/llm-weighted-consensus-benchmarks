I'm trying to discern if the issue is a simple password reset or something more complex.  There's also a mention of \"maternity leave,\" which could be a factor. \n\n\n**Mapping Ticket Details**\n\nI've determined the likely category for this IT ticket is \"Access.\" The user's inability to change their password, indicated by multiple phrases like \"unable to,\" \"problems,\" and \"missed change password,\" directly points to access issues. While \"maternity leave\" is mentioned, it seems contextual rather than the core problem. The other categories, like \"HR Support,\" are tangential, and \"Access\" appears the most precise.\n\n\n**Identifying Core Issue**\n\nI've zeroed in on the \"Access\" category as the most appropriate. The recurring \"change password\" phrases (\"unable,\" \"problems,\" \"missed\") leave no doubt about the core issue being related to user access. I've re-evaluated \"HR Support\" but determined it's contextual; maternity leave might explain the urgency, but not the technical difficulty. The focus is on the inability to change the password, which clearly falls under \"Access.\"\n\n\n"
