After reviewing the text, I've keyed in on \"IT equipment required\" and \"TV screen\" suggesting the primary category is \"Hardware\" as it aligns best with the described need. Further refinement might be needed, but this is the current leaning.\n\n\n**Determining Best Fit Category**\n\nI've determined that \"Purchase\" is the most accurate category. After reviewing the ticket details, it's clear the request is primarily about acquiring new IT equipment, aligning with the purchasing process described. I've considered all other categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Internal Project and Administrative rights and found none that fit. The request goes beyond just hardware, it describes a *procurement request*.\n\n\n"
