The phrases \"added people to pas codes\" and \"please remove\" point me towards Access or Administrative Rights, but I need to consider which is the *primary* focus.\n\n\n**Clarifying the Core Issue**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the ticket text. While administrative rights are intertwined, the central concern seems to be \"Access.\" The user repeatedly requests the removal of codes and project assignments, making \"Access\" the most accurate classification. I'm focusing on the action being requested, and how access control plays a central role.\n\n\n**Determining Primary Focus**\n\nI'm now fully immersed in the core issue. Analyzing the phrases \"added people to pas codes,\" \"please remove,\" and \"tried remove them got error message,\" my focus is honed in on \"Access.\" The repeated requests for removal and the error message strongly suggest a breakdown in access management, making this the critical element.\n\n\n"
