The network element is a factor, but the core issue is the access restriction. I'm weighing whether to consider a more granular sub-category, but initially leaning toward the broader \"Access\" classification.\n\n\n**Defining Access Issues Further**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the consistent theme of access problems in the ticket details. The common thread is the user's inability to interact with the system or specific functionalities, regardless of the underlying cause.  Whether it's network-related, permission-based, or due to a functional change, the outcome is the same: restricted access. I've noted a few different potential causes, but the critical point is the lack of access for the user.\n\n\n**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI've reviewed the ticket text again and it all points clearly to an \"Access\" issue. The core problem is consistent: users are consistently unable to access system functionalities or documents. I considered \"Administrative rights\" but the focus is on the *inability to access* features due to problems, not the rights themselves. The core issue is the users being unable to perform actions or see specific features. The \"Access\" category seems the best fit.\n\n\n"
