The repeated mentions of \"annual leave request,\" coupled with the problems in its approval process, strengthens my prior assessment. It seems the user's issue primarily concerns an annual leave request, and its associated approval processes. Therefore, I believe \"HR Support\" still represents the most appropriate category.\n\n\n"
