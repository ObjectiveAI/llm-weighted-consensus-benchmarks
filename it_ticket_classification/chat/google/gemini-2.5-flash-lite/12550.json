I'm examining the text, noting keywords like \"monitor allocation\" and \"monitor replacement.\" I'm evaluating how these terms relate to my available categories, aiming for the most accurate classification. I believe the ticket is pointing towards an issue with hardware, likely a monitor.\n\n\n**Analyzing Hardware Needs**\n\nI've been analyzing the provided text and concluded it consistently points toward hardware issues. Keywords like \"monitor replacement\" and \"monitors malfunctioning\" make it a clear fit for the \"Hardware\" category. After careful consideration, I've ruled out other categories like \"HR Support\" and \"Access,\" as the content doesn't align with those.\n\n\n**Defining Ticket Category**\n\nI've carefully reviewed the ticket text again. Based on keywords like \"monitor replacement\" and \"monitors malfunctioning\", I'm confident that \"Hardware\" is the most fitting category. I considered other options, but \"Hardware\" aligns best with the identified issue.\n\n\n"
