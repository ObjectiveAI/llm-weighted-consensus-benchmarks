The schema includes categories like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and others. My current thought process involves analyzing phrases within the descriptions to map them to the most relevant category. For the provided example, I'm interpreting \"induction\" as related to onboarding, which may suggest \"HR Support,\" despite the odd phrasing. The goal is to ensure accurate and consistent classification.\n\n\n**Validating HR Categorization**\n\nMy focus has shifted to the repeated use of \"starter form induction\" within the ticket descriptions. This consistently points to an onboarding or offboarding process. I've reevaluated the schema options, and \"HR Support\" remains the most accurate category, based on the nature of HR-related employee processes. The other categories don't seem like they fit the nature of the tickets as well.\n\n\n"
