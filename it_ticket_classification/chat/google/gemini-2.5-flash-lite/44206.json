After analyzing the ticket content, which mentions a \"security issue\" and \"access documents,\" I'm leaning toward selecting the \"Access\" category. The presence of the \"security issue\" element may add nuance to that selection.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nAfter more analysis of the ticket's content, the \"Access\" category is still the best fit. I've ruled out \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and \"Miscellaneous\" as they don't capture the essence of the problem. While \"Storage\" is relevant, the primary concern revolves around *who* can access the stored documents, not the storage system itself. The security and document control concerns solidify the need for careful access management.\n\n\n**Evaluating Access Concerns**\n\nI've further assessed the IT ticket's content and can now confirm that \"Access\" remains the most suitable category. The repeated references to unauthorized downloads, sensitive data exposure, and document permissions strongly support this choice. While storage and security are present, the primary issue is clearly about who has access. The user's concerns about confidential information and the need to limit access solidify \"Access\" as the core problem.\n\n\n"
