The issue described, Outlook constantly disconnecting and prompting for passwords, strongly suggests an email server access problem.  I'm debating if \"Access\" is the most appropriate category, or if it might be more specific than that; perhaps it falls under \"HR Support\" if there are potential user account problems involved.\n\n\n**Confirming Category Choice**\n\nI've honed in on the categorization for this ticket. The Outlook connection issues, particularly the repeated password prompts, are undoubtedly an access problem.  While user account problems could be a factor (which might then fall under HR Support), the core issue directly points to a server access restriction. My analysis of the provided categories solidifies \"Access\" as the appropriate classification.\n\n\n"
