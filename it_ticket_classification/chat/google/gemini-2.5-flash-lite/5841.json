The description mentions \"unable to book restricted rooms,\" which is the core issue. Considering the available categories, \"Access\" seems like the most relevant, indicating a problem with permissions or room booking systems. I'm leaning toward selecting \"Access\" as the primary category for this ticket.\n\n\n**Revisiting Category Assignment**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket description, recognizing keywords like \"unable to book restricted rooms.\" My prior assessment of \"Access\" still seems correct. The expanded context confirms the core problem is room booking, not administrative rights to the system itself. I'm confident \"Access\" is the most fitting category, as it directly addresses the user's struggle to reserve restricted resources. The process has been straightforward this time around, and I don't see any reason to shift.\n\n\n"
