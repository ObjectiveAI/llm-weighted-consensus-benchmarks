I'm focusing specifically on how to analyze the ticket text and map keywords more effectively to the predefined categories, now. My goal is to improve accuracy in assigning the right category, and to handle ambiguous cases gracefully.\n\n\n**Categorizing Leaver Details**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the \"leaver\" examples to refine the category assignment logic. I've noted consistent keywords and phrases tied to departing employees. My focus is now on ensuring those phrases accurately map to \"HR Support\" category, given the nature of managing departing employees' data, access, and resources. I'm also considering how the ticket's structure and the presence of these keywords might influence the output JSON.\n\n\n**Pinpointing Category Match**\n\nI'm now fully immersed in the \"leaver\" ticket analysis. I've considered all angles. The repeated \"leaver\" references strongly suggest that \"Access\" is the most accurate category. I'm prioritizing the importance of revoking access and managing accounts. The focus is on a single key, \"category\", in the JSON response. The ticket text's repeated emphasis on \"leaver\" and related access management is shaping my final decision.\n\n\n**Deciding Ticket Classification**\n\nGiven the ticket's focus on a \"leaver,\" my analysis has honed in on access management. The text repeatedly emphasizes deactivation of accounts, rights, and mailboxes. While HR might trigger this process, the technical tasks fall squarely under \"Access.\" The goal is now to solidify this category assignment in the final JSON output.\n\n\n"
