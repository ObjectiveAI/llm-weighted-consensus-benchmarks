After reviewing the options, I'm leaning towards \"Hardware/Network\" or perhaps \"Telephony.\" Further analysis of the ticket's history might be needed.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Best Fit**\n\nI'm now focusing on categorizing this ticket as \"Hardware,\" given the description of a persistent \"continuous tone\" during calls. I've ruled out all other options, and \"Hardware\" seems the best fit for an issue related to the phone system. The issue sounds hardware/network related more than anything else.\n\n\n"
