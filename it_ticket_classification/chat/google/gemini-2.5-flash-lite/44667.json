So far, the process involves carefully reviewing the user's request to identify key phrases and keywords that will help me classify the ticket.\n\n\n**Classifying Access Request**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's text, identifying phrases like \"unable to access\" and \"give access\". After reviewing each category, \"Access\" is the most precise match. While \"Administrative rights\" is related, the ticket's core request is broader access. It's not about elevated permissions but simply gaining entry. Thus, \"Access\" best encapsulates the user's intent.\n\n\n"
