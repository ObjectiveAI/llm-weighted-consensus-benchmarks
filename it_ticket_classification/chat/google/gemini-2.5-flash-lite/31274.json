After reviewing the provided text (\"update starter form to contain location pm starter form internship\"), I'm leaning toward classifying this as a request that relates to a specific form. I'm considering which category best aligns with the request to \"update\" a \"starter form,\" and how it might be categorized. I'm thinking whether this is an \"HR Support\", \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous\" request, in the end I can provide the best possible category.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Core Issue**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and recurring phrases, particularly \"starter form internship\" and location-related terms. It seems the primary need revolves around updating a form. While \"providing hardware\" pops up, it feels secondary to the form's location details. The repeated \"starter form internship\" strongly suggests HR support is involved. I'm now leaning toward \"HR Support\" as the most suitable category, considering the focus on an internal form related to the internship program.\n\n\n**Revising Category Choice**\n\nNow, I'm re-evaluating, considering both the \"HR Support\" option and \"Internal Project\". The request centers around updating a \"starter form,\"  possibly as part of an ongoing process, as the user mentions a broader \"internship program\". Although hardware is mentioned, the core requirement is an update to an internal form. I believe \"Internal Project\" is the best fit, as the ticket seems more about enhancing an existing process rather than addressing individual HR support needs.\n\n\n"
