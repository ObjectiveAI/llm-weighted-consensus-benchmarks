It looks like it's repeatedly highlighting issues with login attempts, specifically around password expiry. I'm focusing on those keywords to figure out the right category. \"Hardware|HR Support|Access|Miscellaneous|Storage|Purchase|Internal Project|Administrative rights\".\n\n\n**Defining Core Issue**\n\nI've zeroed in on the core issue: it's definitely related to user access. Repeated mentions of login failures, expired passwords, and the need to reset credentials solidify this. I'm confident \"Access\" is the most appropriate category.\n\n\n"
