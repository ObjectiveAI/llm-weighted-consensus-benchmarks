After carefully reviewing the provided text about the access card issue, I'm leaning heavily towards \"Access\" as the most suitable classification. I'm confident in this choice, as the card's functionality directly relates to access control.\n\n\n**Analyzing Access Issues**\n\nI've refined my initial classification of the IT ticket. After deeper analysis, the evidence firmly supports \"Access\" as the prime category. The recurring mentions of the access card's functionality, or lack thereof, solidifies this choice. The problem is squarely about the card's ability to grant or deny access. I've ruled out other categories like \"Hardware\" due to the focus being on the access function, not the hardware itself.\n\n\n"
