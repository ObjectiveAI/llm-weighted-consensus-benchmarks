The phrases \"new addresses for web interviewers\" suggests an \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" issue. However, \"please make administrator\" is clearer and points to an \"Administrative rights\" issue, which appears to be the most accurate classification.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the best option**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the context and user request to nail down the most relevant IT ticket category. The phrasing \"please make administrator add interviewers members\" is critical.  While both \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights\" are contenders, the explicit \"administrator\" action and addition of \"members\" leans me towards \"Administrative rights.\" The request boils down to managing permissions, with an administrator performing the granting.\n\n\n**Clarifying the core issue**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the best IT ticket category. It's becoming evident that \"Access\" is the most precise fit for this request. The ticket's phrasing, \"add interviewers members,\" strongly implies granting user access to a system. The key term is \"members,\" indicating a standard user role. \"Administrative rights\" usually entails elevated privileges for *managing* systems, not standard user access like granting permissions, but \"access\" is a more exact fit.\n\n\n**Confirming category choice**\n\nI'm now fully confident in choosing \"Access\" as the correct IT ticket category. After careful review, \"add interviewers members\" strongly implies granting access, not administering rights. The interviewer members need to *participate*, indicating access to the interviewing platform, while \"Administrative rights\" would mean giving *them* powers to manage, which isn't the primary request here. The emphasis on \"adding\" and \"members\" reinforces access provision, making \"Access\" the optimal category.\n\n\n"
