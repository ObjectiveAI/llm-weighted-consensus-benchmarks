The presence of terms like \"PO incomplete\" and \"requisition\" strongly suggest this category. I'm also ensuring the model differentiates between \"Purchase\" and \"Internal Project\", given the potential overlap in some keywords. Currently, I'm leaning towards \"Purchase\" but need to solidify the decision with further analysis of the ticket content.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Best Fit**\n\nI'm making a clearer decision on the IT ticket's category based on keywords. \"PO incomplete\" and \"requisition active anymore\", and the invoice problem are definite pointers. While there's a reference to \"shared officer,\" the context strongly hints towards purchase. I've ruled out the other possibilities. Purchase is the most likely category based on the available information.\n\n\n"
