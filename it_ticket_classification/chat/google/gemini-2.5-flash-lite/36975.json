The initial clue points toward external clients facing access issues. My goal is to determine if this directly relates to Access, or if it indicates a broader, related problem.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Issue**\n\nThe analysis confirms the issue is related to external clients struggling to access the \"Poseidon\" system. Error messages like \"authentication required\" and access restrictions strongly indicate an \"Access\" problem, directly stemming from the ticket text provided. The issue is likely due to the external client not being able to access the system, or the system not being able to authenticate external clients. The core problem is therefore an \"Access\" issue, rather than any other possible category.\n\n\n**Confirming Access Issues**\n\nI've examined the ticket text carefully, and it unequivocally points to an \"Access\" problem. The repeated mentions of external clients failing to use \"Poseidon\", coupled with the \"authentication required\" and access restriction messages, solidify this categorization. The issue seems to be the system's inability to authenticate these external clients, leading to an \"Access\" problem for this ticket.\n\n\n"
