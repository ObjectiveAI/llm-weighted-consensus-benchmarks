My focus is on identifying keywords and phrases that will point towards the most appropriate category. I'm carefully considering each of the pre-defined categories to ensure the best fit.\n\n\n**Identifying Problem Type**\n\nThe primary issue revolves around the user's inability to change their password and potentially, the inability to access their PC. Keywords \"password\" and \"pc\" are central to the issue. I am currently leaning toward \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" as appropriate categories but need to make a final decision, after considering other potential factors.\n\n\n**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI've closely analyzed the ticket and pinpointed the core problem: the user's struggle to modify their password and potentially, PC access. The \"access\" category resonates most strongly, better than \"Administrative Rights\" which is a more specific subset of the issue at hand.\n\n\n"
