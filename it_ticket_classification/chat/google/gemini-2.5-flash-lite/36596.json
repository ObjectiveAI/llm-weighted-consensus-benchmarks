I've observed the keywords like \"connect,\" \"unable,\" and \"external contacts.\" The context seems to be network-related. My initial thought is to categorize this under \"Access,\" but I'm cross-referencing this to make sure it isn't an HR, or Purchase item. I'll need to consider how to weigh each of the terms in the description.\n\n\n**Revisiting Ticket Categorization**\n\nI'm now revisiting the ticket's categorization, given the context of \"adding external contacts\". My initial leaning towards \"Access\" still feels correct. After reevaluating the options, the issue seems to stem from a lack of permissions or a misconfiguration that impedes external contact additions. Although administrative rights *could* be relevant, the central issue is directly tied to a specific functionality \u2013 therefore, \"Access\" remains the best fit. I've ruled out Hardware, HR Support, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project and Miscellaneous.\n\n\n**Defining the Access Issue**\n\nI'm now fully committed to the \"Access\" categorization. My rationale is that the root cause lies within a permissions or configuration problem, directly impacting the ability to add external contacts. I have thoroughly reviewed the ticket description and available categories, and Access continues to be the most accurate fit. It clearly describes the nature of the difficulty: the user's lack of authorization.\n\n\n"
