The language used, \"client from outside can change password\", strongly indicates an access control problem. The key is to narrow down the specific nature of this access issue to determine the correct categorization. Is this a general security concern, or a specific user-access problem?\n\n\n**Analyzing Access Issue**\n\nI've determined the issue revolves around password management and access to the system. The client's inability to change their password, potentially due to expiration, points to access problems. Examining the text, I ruled out hardware, HR, storage, purchase, internal project, and admin rights categories. Access seems the most fitting classification due to the core issue of account and password management.\n\n\n**Refining the Access Issue**\n\nI've determined that the root cause is indeed access-related. The ticket's text clearly indicates password difficulties, specifically the inability to change a password, likely due to expiration. Considering various categories, I ruled out options like hardware, HR, and storage, and pinpointed \"Access\" as the most relevant. The core issue revolves around password management and account accessibility. \"Administrative rights\" is close, but the crux of the problem seems to be the act of changing the password itself, rather than needing elevated privileges.\n\n\n"
