The ticket refers to \"oracle\" and \"codes expired,\" which I believe points towards a need for either \"Access\" or potentially \"Miscellaneous \" if the expiration isn't directly related to system access. I'm weighing these options to make the most accurate classification.\n\n**Assigning IT Ticket Category**\n\nI'm processing an IT ticket mentioning \"oracle,\" expired \"codes used for absence leave annual leave,\" and an inability to log off or close the month. This strongly suggests an HR Support issue related to leave management systems rather than a general access problem, so I'm leaning towards that classification.\n\n**Classifying HR Ticket Details**\n\nI've reviewed the provided ticket details, focusing on the \"oracle\" context, expired \"absence leave\" and \"annual leave\" codes, and the impact on logging off and closing the month. My analysis strongly indicates that this is an \"HR Support\" issue, as the expired codes directly pertain to HR functions like leave management, rather than a general access problem.\n\n"
