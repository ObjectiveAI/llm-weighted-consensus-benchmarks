Given the content - \"change the line manager...\" - I'm leaning heavily towards \"HR Support.\" It doesn't seem to relate to hardware, access, storage, purchases, or internal projects. However, \"Administrative rights\" is a minor consideration as it may be necessary to implement the line manager change.\n\n\n**Confirming HR Classification**\n\nI've analyzed the ticket content again. The phrase \"change line manager\" is the crux. While \"administrative rights\" could be involved, the primary focus remains personnel management. The repetition reinforces the \"HR Support\" classification as the most accurate fit. It is my firm conclusion that this ticket should be categorized as HR Support.\n\n\n"
