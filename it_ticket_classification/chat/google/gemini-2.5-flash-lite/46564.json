I'm leaning toward \"Access\" but need to confirm if it encompasses this scenario fully.\n\n\n**Defining the Best Fit**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's text and the available categories. Phrases like \"close his accounts\" and \"no longer part\" point squarely towards access management. After reviewing the options (\"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative rights\"), \"Access\" emerged as the most precise fit for this scenario.\n\n\n"
