While the user is asking for investigation, they are also clearly experiencing an access problem, and I am leaning towards this being the primary focus.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Access Problems**\n\nI've honed in on the central issue: access. The phrases, \"password change issues\" and \"repeatedly getting up following recent change,\" strongly point towards an access problem, not something else. The request to \"investigate resolve\" confirms this focus, and I'm confident in categorizing this ticket as \"Access\".\n\n\n"
