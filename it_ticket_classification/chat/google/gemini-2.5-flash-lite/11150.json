My next step involves systematically analyzing the provided text for keywords and contextual clues, aiming to precisely map each ticket to its most fitting category from the established enum list.\n\n**Mapping Ticket Categories**\n\nI'm diligently working to categorize the incoming IT ticket. My focus is on analyzing the text for key terms like \"integration,\" \"repositories,\" and \"creation,\" and correlating these with procedural elements such as \"setup form\" to assign it to the most accurate category within the provided enum.\n\n**Defining Ticket Scope**\n\nI'm actively analyzing the ticket's content, specifically focusing on keywords like \"repositories,\" \"integrations,\" and \"jobs.\" My current thought process is to discern whether these elements point towards an \"Internal Project\" or a broader \"Access\" request, given the mention of setup forms and developer roles.\n\n**Developing Project Category Logic**\n\nI'm refining the logic for \"Internal Project\" classification. My current thought process is to solidify the criteria for differentiating it from \"Access,\" based on the strong indicators of code repositories, job creation, and integration workflows mentioned in the ticket.\n\n"
