My initial analysis suggests that \"Access\" might be the most suitable category for this particular request related to a password reset. However, I'm carefully considering the nuances to ensure the most accurate categorization. I am double checking all other categories to be sure.\n\n\n**Categorizing Access Issues**\n\nI've determined that the ticket concerns a password reset and computer access changes. Despite some ambiguity in the text, phrases like \"reset password\" and \"change pc\" strongly point to \"Access\" as the primary category. I've disregarded other categories like \"Hardware\" since the core request revolves around managing access credentials, not the physical PC itself. My analysis confirms this classification.\n\n\n"
