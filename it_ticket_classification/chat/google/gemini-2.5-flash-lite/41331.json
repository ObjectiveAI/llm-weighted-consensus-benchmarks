After careful consideration of the provided descriptions, I'm leaning toward \"Internal Project\" as the most suitable classification. The description of cloned changes and their lingering \"active\" status suggests a deeper internal workflow issue, rather than a hardware malfunction or access problem. I'm still considering other categories but \"Internal Project\" seems most apt.\n\n\n**Re-evaluating Ticket Classification**\n\nI'm reconsidering the initial categorization. While \"Internal Project\" seemed likely at first, the deeper dive reveals the core issue lies within the IT \"change management\" process itself. The cloned changes and lingering \"active\" status point to a malfunction in this system. I believe this reclassification to the more generalized \"IT\" classification is more accurate.\n\n\n**Refining Category Assignment**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the best fit. While \"Miscellaneous\" seemed plausible, I've reconsidered. The focus is definitely on a system-level malfunction within the IT change management workflow. The \"change cloned\" and \"active\" status persist despite modifications, suggesting a process error. Given the options, I'm leaning toward \"Miscellaneous\" as the closest match, despite the lack of a \"ITSM\" or similar category. It's a system bug affecting a core IT process.\n\n\n**Selecting Ticket Classification**\n\nMy current thinking is focused on finalizing the \"Miscellaneous\" categorization. While the issue is a system bug within IT change management, none of the other categories perfectly describe the problem's nature. \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and others are clearly irrelevant. \"Internal Project\" doesn't quite fit unless the change management system itself is considered a project, which isn't the primary focus. I'm choosing \"Miscellaneous\" because it's the best option given the provided categories.\n\n\n"
