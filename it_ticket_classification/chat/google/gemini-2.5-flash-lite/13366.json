The phrases \"add employees\" and \"provide wireless access\" are being weighed against the available options: \"Hardware\", \"HR Support\", \"Access\", \"Miscellaneous\", \"Storage\", \"Purchase\", \"Internal Project\", and \"Administrative rights.\" The focus is on the core action required to properly assign the ticket.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Optimal Category**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the ticket text and the available categories. \"Access\" seems like the most fitting category, given the recurrent requests for wireless and open access for employees, despite HR involvement with adding employees. I considered \"HR Support\" but it's more about the initiation than the technical provisioning requested in this ticket. The focus is on the specific access the user requires.\n\n\n**Defining the Best Fit**\n\nI'm now fully committed to the \"Access\" category. The text consistently refers to access provisioning for new employees, specifically wireless and open network access. Although \"HR Support\" has a slight relevance because it involves adding employees, the core of the request is technical access configuration, and therefore, I've discarded it as less appropriate.\n\n\n"
