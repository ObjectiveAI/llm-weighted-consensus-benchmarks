After analyzing the provided content (\"cannot submit time card...\"), I'm leaning toward \"HR Support\" as the most relevant category. However, I'm also considering potential overlaps with other categories like \"Access\" due to the timecard system interaction, but I think \"HR Support\" is the most appropriate. I'm now exploring the ticket from other angles.\n\n\n**Revising Category Choice**\n\nAfter further thought, I've confirmed my initial leaning towards \"HR Support\". The phrase \"cannot submit timecard\" strongly suggests an issue related to HR processes and systems. While \"Access\" could be a factor, the core problem presented is about submitting a timecard, which falls squarely within the HR domain. The content implies that the user is not just unable to use the system, but rather that there is a timecard related problem. I think this is where the ticket falls.\n\n\n"
