The presence of terms like \"new purchase,\" \"PO,\" and \"purchased,\" alongside specific hardware like a \"wireless mobile mouse,\" strongly suggests a connection to the purchasing process. This points me to leaning towards the \"Purchase\" category, but I am still open to other categories, such as \"Hardware,\" if the request is also related to it.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Ticket Assignment**\n\nI've honed in on the \"Purchase\" category as the best fit for this IT ticket. The keywords, particularly \"new purchase\" and the mention of a \"wireless mobile mouse\", solidify this decision. While \"Hardware\" was initially considered, the focus appears to be on the procurement aspect, making \"Purchase\" the primary focus.\n\n\n"
