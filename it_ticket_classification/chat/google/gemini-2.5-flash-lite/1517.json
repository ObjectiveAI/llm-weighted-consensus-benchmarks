The ticket text \"password reset for external client expire today\" seems to point towards \"Access\". This choice seems logical, as it directly involves access credentials and their expiration. I'll make sure to double-check other options, but \"Access\" is looking like the frontrunner.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down Options**\n\nI'm now refining the ticket category choice. Considering the latest examples, \"Access\" still seems like the best fit, given the focus on external client password resets and shared resource access. While other categories might touch on related concepts, \"Access\" encapsulates the core issue. I'll prioritize confirming this, and ensure it aligns with overall best practices.\n\n\n**Finalizing Category Selection**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket text and the available categories. The repeated phrases like \"expire today\" and the emphasis on \"external client\" and \"shared sources\" definitively point towards an access-related issue. \"Access\" is the most fitting category, encompassing password resets and access to shared resources. While other options were explored, \"Access\" best encapsulates the core problem. This selection aligns with best practices and accurately reflects the ticket's primary concern.\n\n\n"
