The phrase \"new starter\" strongly suggests this is about onboarding, so \"Access\" seems relevant. The details are sparse, but setting up access for a new employee is the key action. I'm leaning toward \"Access\" but need more info.\n\n\n**Refining Category Choice**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on \"Access\" as the prime choice. The \"new starter\" context consistently points toward onboarding, which necessitates providing access to various IT resources. While other categories might touch on related aspects, like HR or administrative tasks, \"Access\" directly addresses the core requirement indicated in the ticket text. The meeting or deadline mentioned further emphasizes the time-sensitive nature of setting up access.\n\n\n**Finalizing Category Selection**\n\nI've decided to proceed with \"Access\" as the most appropriate category for the IT ticket. My thought process consistently centers on the critical requirement for new starters to gain access to necessary systems. While \"HR Support\" has its merits, the direct implication of IT-related actions for a new employee leans heavily towards access provisioning. Therefore, the ticket's core function appears to be about enabling a new employee's access.\n\n\n"
