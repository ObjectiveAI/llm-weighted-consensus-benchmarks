The available categories are in view, and I'm carefully considering how well each aligns with the provided problem description. Hardware seems like a likely candidate, but I'm also considering the potential for a purchase request if a replacement is needed.\n\n\n**Determining the Best Fit**\n\nI've been analyzing the ticket's text, identifying key phrases such as \"laptop keyboard problems\" and \"spilled coffee.\" My focus is on determining the best-fit category from the list. \"Hardware\" is the most direct match, as the issue is a physical component damaged. While \"Purchase\" might apply if a replacement is needed, the request is primarily for repair or replacement of a hardware part. The other categories are unrelated to the described problem.\n\n\n"
