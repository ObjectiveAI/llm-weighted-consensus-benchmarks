While other categories exist, the user's focus on email storage points toward Storage as the likely category. I'm exploring potential solutions within that realm.\n\n\n**Focusing on Categorization**\n\nI've narrowed the focus, concluding that \"Storage\" is the most fitting category for this ticket. The user explicitly references a \"mailbox full\" issue, which aligns directly with storage concerns. While other categories are options, the wording used points unmistakably to Storage as the appropriate classification.\n\n\n"
