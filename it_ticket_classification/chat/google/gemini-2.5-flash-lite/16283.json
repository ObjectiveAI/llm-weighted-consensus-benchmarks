My initial analysis suggests that terms like \"modify\" might indicate a need for **Administrative rights**, or potentially **Internal Project**, but I'm cross-referencing these terms to be more precise in my mapping. I'm going to start by analyzing the available categories to establish clear rules for matching the keywords found in each ticket.\n\n\n**Analyzing Ticket Text**\n\nI've just finished analyzing the ticket text and am leaning towards \"Administrative rights\" as the most suitable category. The phrases \"user administration\" and \"transformed name\" strongly suggest modifications within user access controls. While \"Access\" could be argued, \"Administrative rights\" more directly reflects the level of change implied. I am now confident in my selection based on this in-depth textual analysis.\n\n\n**Confirming Ticket Category**\n\nI've evaluated the provided text and have determined that \"Administrative rights\" is the most relevant category. The text highlights modifications within \"user administration\" including \"transformed name\", directly linking to system administrative tasks. While \"Access\" could be a viable option, \"Administrative rights\" provides a more definitive reflection of the work entailed. My decision is based on an in-depth analysis of key phrases and their implications.\n\n\n"
