I'm focusing on the crucial \"requisition entered\" text. I'm carefully considering the available categories: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights,\" to find the best match for it.\n\n\n**Categorizing Ticket: Purchase**\n\nI've just concluded that the ticket's text, rich with phrases like \"requisition,\" \"mobile phone,\" and \"supplier,\" strongly points to a \"Purchase\" request. While \"Hardware\" was initially considered, the focus on the buying process solidified \"Purchase\" as the most precise category. It aligns perfectly with the user's intent to acquire a mobile phone.\n\n\n"
