Based on the text, \"issue with submitting leaves,\" it appears related to an HR system or process. I am leaning towards \"HR Support\" as the most appropriate classification. However, I will need to consider the other options before finalizing the determination.\n\n\n**Confirming the Classification**\n\nI've analyzed the ticket text: \"issue with submitting leaves oracle issue with submitting leaves dear cannot submit annual leave could you please help with need submit today kind regard specialist.\" The keywords \"submitting leaves\" and \"annual leave\" strongly suggest an HR-related issue. My analysis points to \"HR Support\" as the definitive category, and I've constructed the corresponding JSON object to reflect this conclusion.\n\n\n"
