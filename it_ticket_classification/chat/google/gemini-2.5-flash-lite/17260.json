I'm leaning toward either \"Access\" or \"Purchase,\" but the request's context is still fuzzy. I need to figure out which category fits this specific request the best, as this could involve a new role or an internal system.\n\n\n**Refining Categorization Strategy**\n\nNow, I'm analyzing the ticket text more deeply, focusing on \"technical evaluator,\" \"added,\" and \"requisition.\" The term \"requisition\" nudges me toward \"Purchase\" or \"Internal Project,\" but I think \"Access\" fits the primary action, which is granting permissions. I am leaning toward the hypothesis of an IT role and related system privileges.\n\n\n**Narrowing Category Focus**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on \"Access\" as the primary category. The ticket's focus is clearly on enabling a \"technical evaluator\" with system permissions. The keywords \"added\" and \"requisition\" reinforce this. Though \"HR Support\" has a slight possibility, granting access aligns better with the core request.\n\n\n**Defining Optimal Category Choice**\n\nNow, I'm analyzing the ticket text more deeply, focusing on the key phrase: \"add technical evaluator\". Considering it requires provisioning a new role, I'm going with \"Access\". While it is a requisition, I'm disregarding the other options because I think \"Access\" fits the primary action, which is granting permissions. I am leaning toward the hypothesis of an IT role and related system privileges.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Category Selection**\n\nMy thinking has solidified around the \"Access\" category. The text indicates that the key action is provisioning a \"technical evaluator,\" which strongly suggests the need for system permissions. Though other categories have been considered, \"Access\" aligns best with the core request.\n\n\n"
