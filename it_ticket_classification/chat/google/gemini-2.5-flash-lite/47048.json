My immediate focus is to analyze the description and assign it to the most appropriate category from the provided list: [\"Hardware\", \"HR Support\", \"Access\", \"Miscellaneous\", \"Storage\", \"Purchase\", \"Internal Project\", \"Administrative rights\"]. The mention of \"workstation issue unresponsive\" strongly suggests a \"Hardware\" classification.\n\n**Assigning Ticket Category**\n\nI'm finalizing the classification of this IT ticket. Given the repeated mentions of an unresponsive workstation and the inability to use it properly after startup, I'm strongly leaning towards the \"Hardware\" category for this issue.\n\n**Selecting Ticket Category**\n\nI've analyzed the details, and based on the recurring descriptions of the workstation becoming unresponsive and unusable, I'm assigning this ticket to the \"Hardware\" category. This seems the most direct classification given the core issue.\n\n"
