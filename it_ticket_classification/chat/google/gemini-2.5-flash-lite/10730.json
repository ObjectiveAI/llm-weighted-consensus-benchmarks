My current analysis leans towards \"HR Support\" due to the \"leaver\" context, though \"Hardware\" also seems relevant given the mobile device mentions. I will finalize the categorization after a thorough assessment.\n\n**Assigning Ticket Category**\n\nI'm currently assessing the ticket text, focusing on the terms \"leaver\" and \"mobile phone.\" My analysis suggests that the primary driver for this ticket revolves around HR processes, specifically managing IT assets for departing employees. Therefore, I'm leaning towards categorizing it as \"HR Support.\"\n\n**Confirming Ticket Categorization**\n\nI've finalized my assessment of the ticket text, and based on the strong indicators like \"leaver,\" I've confirmed the category as \"HR Support.\" This reflects the process-driven nature of managing IT assets for departing employees.\n\n"
