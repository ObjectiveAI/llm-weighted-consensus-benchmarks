Now, I'm considering which category best aligns with this language, and which one will effectively address the user's need.\n\n\n**Defining the Categorization**\n\nI've solidified my selection of \"Purchase\" as the correct category, considering the consistent presence of \"purchase\" throughout the ticket text. This category directly addresses the user's intent. The evidence is robust, making the decision straightforward. My approach is to zero in on the core subject matter.\n\n\n"
