The content is proving somewhat challenging, but I'm leaning toward \"Access\" due to the mention of access to files and layouts. I need to make sure this is the most accurate category, but I think it is.\n\n\n**Revising Category Choice**\n\nAfter reviewing the ticket again and exploring other categories, I've decided to refine my initial assessment. While \"Access\" still seems most applicable, the context of \"testing bid squad member\" makes \"Internal Project\" a strong possibility as well. It could be for the project, but the emphasis is more on giving access *for* the project. I'm going to lean towards \"Access\" as the primary focus is still granting permissions to resources.\n\n\n**Refining Categorization Decision**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket's keywords, and \"Access\" remains the most accurate category. While \"Internal Project\" was initially considered, the focus is definitively on granting permissions rather than the project's internal management. The user needs access to files and resources for testing purposes. Therefore, \"Access\" best captures the essence of the ticket's core request.\n\n\n"
