Initial thoughts lean toward \"HR Support\" due to the mention of a \"starter form\" and \"new starter.\" I'm carefully reviewing the terms to ensure a definitive assignment. There are no other immediate obvious options.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the ticket content, and the focus is squarely on the \"new starter\" and \"starter form\" aspects, with the contractor context. While access setup might follow, the initial request revolves around the onboarding process. \"HR Support\" appears the most accurate categorization, given the emphasis on the initiation of an employee or contractor. The other categories seem less relevant given the available information.\n\n\n**Determining Ticket Priority**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the best category for this ticket, and the \"HR Support\" label is solidified as the most accurate classification. My reasoning centers on the core issue: initiating the onboarding process for a new contractor, which involves the use of a \"starter form.\" Although access is relevant, it seems like a subsequent step after the HR process.\n\n\n"
