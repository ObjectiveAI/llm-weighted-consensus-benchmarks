The phrase \"create a new ad and rule\" is leading me towards a specific classification within the provided options.\n\n**Configuring Access Policies**\n\nI'm narrowing down the category for the ticket. The emphasis on \"ad\" and \"rule\" strongly suggests a focus on access control or network policy, aligning with the \"Access\" classification.\n\n**Categorizing Ticket Details**\n\nI'm focusing on the core IT actions described. Phrases like \"create ad rule,\" \"connect users,\" \"assign,\" and \"gateway\" are strongly pointing towards network configuration and user management. This makes \"Access\" the most fitting category.\n\n**Determining Ticket Classification**\n\nI'm refining the classification. The extensive details about code, requirements, planning, and client agreement strongly indicate an \"Internal Project\" rather than a simpler access or administrative task.\n\n"
