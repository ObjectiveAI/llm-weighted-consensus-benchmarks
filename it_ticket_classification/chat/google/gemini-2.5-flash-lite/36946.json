The ticket text's mention of \"multiplied notifications\" and \"duplicate submission\" suggests a system-related problem rather than a hardware or HR issue. I'm leaning toward either \"Access\" or \"Miscellaneous,\" but need to clarify if this is a general system malfunction or a specific access-control glitch. It's a tricky one.\n\n\n**Finalizing the Classification**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's details. The repeated notifications and duplicate entries, linked to an approval workflow, point toward a system-level glitch rather than hardware, HR, access permissions, storage, or purchase-related issues. While \"Internal Project\" is not the most applicable here. I've concluded that \"Miscellaneous\" is the most suitable category.\n\n\n**Revising the Selection**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket details, with focus on the approval process and multiplied notifications. It's becoming clearer that this is not an access or HR matter. The system's generation of redundant notifications and duplicate entries indicates a system bug or workflow problem, not hardware, storage or purchase. While it could be an \"Internal Project,\" it's likely just a system bug that's part of an internal project and does not warrant a project categorization. Consequently, I'm confident \"Miscellaneous\" is the accurate fit, given the limited choices, even though a \"System Bug\" or \"Workflow Error\" would be ideal.\n\n\n"
