Given the content mentioning \"installation,\" \"delivery,\" and the lack of other clear keywords, I lean towards \"Hardware\" or potentially \"Internal Project,\" but I'm still trying to confirm if these are appropriate. I'm carefully analyzing each word to make sure I don't overlook any hidden cues that may point towards a different category.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Purchase Category**\n\nMy analysis now firmly points towards the \"Purchase\" category. The ticket's focus on \"new delivery,\" \"order numbers,\" \"POs,\" and \"invoices\" makes this the most fitting classification. It's clearly a procurement-related issue, specifically dealing with the process of acquiring and receiving hardware. The \"Hardware\" category remains a possibility, as the installations are part of the process, but \"Purchase\" feels more encompassing for the entire scope.\n\n\n**Categorizing Purchase Process**\n\nMy assessment now zeroes in on the \"Purchase\" category. The ticket describes a \"new delivery\" tied to \"order numbers,\" \"POs,\" and an \"invoice,\" which directly relates to procurement of the hardware. The \"installation\" is a supporting activity; the core of the ticket is the purchase and delivery process. I'm satisfied that \"Purchase\" is the primary driver, rather than simply \"Hardware.\"\n\n\n"
