Keywords like \"purchase,\" and \"installation\" strongly suggest a **Purchase** related issue. I'm verifying that other categories don't apply, based on the text.\n\n\n**Analyzing Ticket Content**\n\nI've been analyzing the ticket's text, identifying key phrases such as \"purchase,\" \"docking station,\" and \"installation.\" The focus is clearly on acquiring new hardware. My initial categorization leans heavily toward \"Purchase,\" as the ticket details a request for an item and its installation. I'm cross-referencing this against the other categories to confirm my assessment. The frequent \"purchase\" related words are the most relevant.\n\n\n**Finalizing Category Selection**\n\nI've thoroughly analyzed the ticket text, noting the consistent focus on \"purchase,\" \"docking station,\" and \"installation.\" While \"hardware\" is a factor, the overarching theme is the acquisition process. I've considered all categories, and determined the most accurate categorization is \"Purchase.\" It captures the ordering, delivery, and installation aspects, aligning with the user's intent to acquire hardware.\n\n\n"
