It seems the user needs help generating a specific report, possibly for salary reviews or other HR-related tasks. I'm leaning toward the category that best encapsulates report generation assistance.\n\n\n**Revising Category Choice**\n\nI've refined my initial HR support classification. Analyzing keywords like \"export\" and \"run\" within the context of \"salary review\" strengthens the HR connection. The phrase \"active employees\" further cements the HR domain relevance. I'm focusing on the interplay between report generation and core HR functions.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Best Fit**\n\nI'm confident in HR Support now. The language in the ticket, especially \"salary review,\" \"active employees,\" and \"organization,\" makes it a clear match. \"Export definition\" and \"run export\" further bolster the HR connection. The report itself appears to be a specific output needed for an HR function. It seems the user needs help to obtain it.\n\n\n"
