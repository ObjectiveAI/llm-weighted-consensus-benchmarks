The key phrases \"new starter\" and \"return from maternity\" strongly suggest HR Support is the primary focus. However, the mention of \"administrator\" introduces a potential crossover with Access or Administrative Rights. I'll need to consider how to weigh these elements to make the best call.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Ticket Components**\n\nI've refined my initial assessment. While access plays a role, focusing on the broader HR implications is the key here. The emphasis on \"new starter\" and \"return from maternity leave\" makes HR Support the primary category. The \"administrator\" mention adds a layer regarding access management, but it remains secondary to the core HR-driven need. This ticket focuses mainly on HR workflows for onboarding and access.\n\n\n**Refining Category Selection**\n\nI'm now fully committed to \"HR Support\" as the best category. The ticket's core revolves around an employee's return, an event that primarily impacts HR, triggering various IT tasks related to access and system setup. Though \"Access\" is relevant, \"HR Support\" is more comprehensive. It encapsulates the broader context of an employee lifecycle event, which encompasses the access-related work as a subset.\n\n\n"
