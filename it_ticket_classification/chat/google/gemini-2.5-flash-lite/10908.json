The phrase \"leaver center\" has pointed me towards a potential HR Support issue. I'm now cross-referencing this with the other possible categories to confirm if this is indeed the best fit or if the context warrants a different classification.\n\n\n**Defining Category: Leaver Process**\n\nMy latest analysis centers on the \"leaver center\" context. The phrase, alongside terms like \"leaver mailbox\" and \"ad rights,\" points firmly towards an HR Support issue, not just access management. Although \"ad rights\" are included, the comprehensive departure process is the core. I am now certain HR Support is the most appropriate category, and I am finalizing my reasoning to support that conclusion.\n\n\n"
