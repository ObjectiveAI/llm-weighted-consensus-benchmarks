After analyzing the provided text, especially the recurring keywords like \"expense reports,\" \"submitting,\" and \"saved,\" I am now leaning towards a potential category. I'm carefully comparing the text to the allowed category list,  prioritizing accuracy and relevance.\n\n\n**Finalizing the Classification**\n\nI've just concluded my analysis and settled on \"Internal Project\" as the appropriate category. While \"Miscellaneous\" was a possibility, \"Internal Project\" best reflects the nature of the ticket. The text centers on a workflow issue related to expense reports, which is a system-related problem within the company's operations. The presence of roles like \"pm,\" \"engineer,\" and \"test lead\" solidified my decision, pointing to an internal development or support context rather than other options like hardware, HR, access, or storage concerns. I'm ready to mark the ticket with this classification.\n\n\n**Reaching a Conclusion**\n\nI have carefully assessed the ticket text and reviewed all category options. The keyword \"expense reports\" strongly indicates a system-related matter. The presence of terms like \"dashboard\" and \"flow,\" combined with roles like \"pm\" and \"engineer,\" aligns perfectly with \"Internal Project.\" Unlike \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Internal Project\" accurately captures the nature of this IT request. I am now confident in my classification.\n\n\n"
