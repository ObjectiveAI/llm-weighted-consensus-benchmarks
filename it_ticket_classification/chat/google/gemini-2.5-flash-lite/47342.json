This aligns well with the user's focus on IT-related tasks, such as categorization of tickets.\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nMy focus has shifted slightly, now solidifying the \"Hardware\" categorization for the IT ticket. Despite the cable being the culprit, the initial issue stemmed from a hardware malfunction (monitor flicker), and the resolution involved a hardware component (cable). This decision aligns with the user's focus on IT tasks. I am now proceeding to output the JSON object with the \"category\" field set to \"Hardware.\"\n\n\n"
