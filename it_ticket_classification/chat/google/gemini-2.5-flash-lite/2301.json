The user requests I choose from several predefined categories. \"Update marquee\" seems significant, appearing often in the content. This could hint at hardware, as marquees often involve displays, but could also relate to access. I am focused on filtering out the noise to identify the core issue, as the repeated phrase is giving me a hint as to the content of the ticket.\n\n\n**Analyzing Access Request**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and evaluating the most fitting category. While \"update marquee\" appears, the core lies in managing user access to this feature. It involves adding and removing \"colleagues\" from \"groups\" within the \"marquee,\" making \"Access\" the best fit. I'm focusing on the action, not the tool. The user aims to control who sees what, which is ultimately an Access Management function.\n\n\n**Pinpointing Access Control**\n\nI'm deep into categorizing the IT ticket. After careful analysis, I've eliminated \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and others. My attention has centered on \"Access\" due to the recurring theme of managing \"colleagues\" and \"groups\" within the \"marquee\" system. The focus isn't about physical hardware or general HR issues. The essence here is controlling user access, confirming \"Access\" as the best fit.\n\n\n"
