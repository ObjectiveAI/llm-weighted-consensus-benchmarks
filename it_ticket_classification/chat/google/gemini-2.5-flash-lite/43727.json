The morning access issues, affecting specific floors, seem key. \"Clock\" and \"pass through filter\" are definitely relevant details. The fact that the card functioned later in the day points towards possible intermittent connectivity or a time-related glitch.\n\n\n**Refining Access Classification**\n\nI'm solidifying the ticket categorization. The \"Access\" category is the clear winner, aligning perfectly with the core issue. I've considered and rejected other options like Hardware, HR Support, and Miscellaneous, each failing to capture the essence of the access control system problem.\n\n\n**Finalizing the Categorization**\n\nI've determined that \"Access\" is the most accurate category. After reviewing the context, the user's focus on a \"pass card\" and the \"st th floors\" access issue clearly indicates a physical access control system problem. \"Clock\" and \"pass through filter\" further solidified this connection, rejecting other general categories such as \"Miscellaneous\" or more specific ones like \"Hardware\" or \"HR Support\" that don't cover the issue at its root.\n\n\n"
