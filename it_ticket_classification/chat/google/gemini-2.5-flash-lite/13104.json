However, \"reformat document\" feels more like \"Miscellaneous\". I'll continue to weigh these options based on the available categories.\n\n\n**Categorizing the IT Request**\n\nI've refined my initial analysis. The phrases \"future editing document\" and \"installed image needed\" are prompting me to reassess. I'm leaning toward \"Internal Project\" due to the document editing and image installation. The VM aspect still complicates it, but the project focus feels stronger than a straightforward \"Storage\" issue. I'm now comparing this against \"Miscellaneous\", considering the ambiguity of \"reformat document purpose\".\n\n\n**Prioritizing Project Scope**\n\nI've carefully re-examined the ticket context, specifically focusing on the new addition: \"purpose also installed image needed.\" This has solidified my leaning toward \"Internal Project.\" The \"document purpose\" coupled with the need for a specific image suggests a project-based environment setup. While the VM aspect links to \"Storage,\" the goal seems project-centric, not just storage-related. I'm now comparing this directly against \"Internal Project\" to ensure the fit is precise.\n\n\n"
