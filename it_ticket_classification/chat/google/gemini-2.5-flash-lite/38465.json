                    "reasoning": "**Identifying Ticket Category**\n\nI'm currently focused on determining the correct IT ticket category. The text indicates issues with \"oracle fusion expense,\" suggesting a possible link to \"HR Support\" or a more general \"Miscellaneous\" issue. The phrases \"change code\" and \"pre sales for\" make me consider \"Internal Project\" as a potential fit as well. I'm leaning towards \"HR Support,\" but need to weigh the context further.\n\n\n**Narrowing Ticket Classification**\n\nI'm now narrowing down the classification based on further analysis of the keywords. The core issue revolves around a malfunctioning application (\"fusion expense\"), requiring a \"code change\" and impacting \"pre sales\" activities. This doesn't seem to fit \"HR Support\" as initially thought. \"Internal Project\" might apply if the code change is part of a larger project, but the \"pre sales\" element hints at a more direct business process issue. \"Miscellaneous\" remains too vague, and other categories are irrelevant. I'm leaning toward an IT operations or application support category, but need to be sure it is the best fit.\n\n\n**Refining Category Determination**\n\nI'm now carefully re-evaluating the ticket's core issue: \"oracle fusion expense\" is consistently faulty and necessitates code or configuration changes, impacting client pre-sales. I'm currently leaning towards \"Internal Project\" as the ticket focuses on improving or modifying an internal system, even if it has external implications. \"Miscellaneous\" remains too vague, while others like \"HR Support\" or \"Access\" don't align with the system's operational malfunction. I am now confident that the primary aim is to enhance an internally-used system.\n\n\n**Analyzing System Functionality**\n\nI'm now carefully examining the ticket's description, considering both \"Internal Project\" and the potential for a functional system fix. The \"oracle fusion expense\" issue, requiring code changes and impacting \"pre sales\", points towards a core application problem that impacts client-facing operations. While the nature of code changes suggests an \"Internal Project,\" the focus on fixing a recurring error in an existing system leans towards a functional category related to application support. I am now certain the focus is on resolving a specific system malfunction.\n\n\n**Determining Application Issue**\n\nI'm now carefully examining the ticket's core problem, which is a malfunctioning \"oracle fusion expense\" system requiring code modification and impacting client pre-sales. I've considered that while \"Internal Project\" could fit, the core issue seems to be a functional problem with the application. Without a dedicated \"Application Support\" category, I am leaning toward \"Internal Project\" as it covers development work related to an internal system.\n\n\n**Determining System Modification**\n\nI'm now carefully examining the ticket's description, considering both \"Internal Project\" and the need for a specific system fix. The ticket revolves around a recurring application error in Oracle Fusion Expense, which requires code modifications and impacts pre-sales activities. The \"change code\" and \"hard configured\" elements strongly indicate development or modification work on an internal system.\n\n\n"
