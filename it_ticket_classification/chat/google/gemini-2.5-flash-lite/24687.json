I am analyzing the content to identify the most fitting category from the specified list, paying close attention to recurring themes. My initial approach involves breaking down the text to find the most relevant keywords.\n\n\n**Defining Core Problem**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the text within the IT ticket, and I'm starting to home in on the central issue. It seems to revolve around migrating files and folders, with permissions and upload limitations playing a significant role. Key phrases like \"migrate,\" \"copy,\" \"permissions,\" and \"big files\" keep reappearing, making it clear that storage and access are crucial. This suggests potential issues falling under \"Storage\" and \"Access\", perhaps needing to combine them or lean towards one more than the other.\n\n\n**Pinpointing Primary Issues**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the primary concerns. \"Storage\" and \"Access\" remain strong contenders, but after a deep dive, I believe the core problem rests with \"Storage\". The text focuses on the *process* of moving, managing, and storing files, as well as encountering limits around it, with some access issues being a consequence. It appears the main aim is to efficiently manage storage and the information within, from old archived files to moving and deleting content.\n\n\n**Determining Primary Category**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's content, focusing on the keywords and recurring themes. While access issues are mentioned, the central problem revolves around migrating, copying, and managing files/folders with associated limitations. This strongly indicates that the main issue falls under **Storage** due to its relevance with data organization and movement. The user is experiencing storage-related limitations.\n\n\n**Identifying the Core Issue**\n\nI've thoroughly analyzed the IT ticket, and the central problem is clear: it revolves around data migration and storage management. The text repeatedly references copying, uploading, archiving, and deleting files and folders, with limitations related to file size and permissions. This ongoing work strongly confirms the underlying \"Storage\" issues, even though access/permissions may be a *consequence* of these problems.\n\n\n"
