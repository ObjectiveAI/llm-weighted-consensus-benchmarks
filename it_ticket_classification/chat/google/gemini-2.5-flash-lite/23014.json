The phrases \"additional cable\" and \"monitor\" keep recurring. I'm leaning toward \"Hardware\" given the context, but I need to ensure there are no other hints or suggestions that indicate another category. Further analysis is ongoing to confirm my initial assumption.\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nMy focus remains on classifying this ticket. I've re-examined the text, specifically the phrase \"programming needs,\" which initially caused a minor hesitation. However, given that the core requirement is an \"additional cable for monitor,\" I've confirmed that \"Hardware\" is the most apt categorization. I'm now confident in this assignment.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Optimal Category**\n\nI've carefully re-evaluated the ticket text. While \"programming needs\" initially warranted a second look, the core request remains a hardware component: an \"additional cable for monitor.\" After considering all potential categories, I'm confident \"Hardware\" is the most precise and accurate classification for this request.\n\n\n"
