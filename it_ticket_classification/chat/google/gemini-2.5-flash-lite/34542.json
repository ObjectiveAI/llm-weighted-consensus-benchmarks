I will attempt to infer the most likely category based on common initial user interactions in ticket systems.\n\n**Assigning IT Ticket Category**\n\nI've analyzed the provided IT ticket text. Based on keywords like \"component compatible,\" \"installed,\" and \"not installed,\" I've determined the most fitting category to be \"Hardware.\" This seems to capture the essence of the user's issue with system components.\n\n**Selecting IT Ticket Category**\n\nI've processed the latest IT ticket input. By examining terms like \"component,\" \"compatible,\" \"installed,\" and \"not installed,\" I've pinpointed \"Hardware\" as the most suitable categorization. This aligns with the user's expressed concerns about system components.\n\n"
