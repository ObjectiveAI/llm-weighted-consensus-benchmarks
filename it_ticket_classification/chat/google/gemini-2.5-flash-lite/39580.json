I'm focusing on accurately mapping the ticket's details to the most appropriate classification.\n\n**Classifying Meeting Duplication**\n\nI'm evaluating the IT ticket details, which involve duplicated Outlook meetings and reminders. After reviewing the provided categories, I've determined that the issue doesn't fit neatly into specific areas like hardware or access. Therefore, I'm leaning towards \"Miscellaneous\" as the most appropriate classification for this software anomaly.\n\n"
