This strongly aligns with the \"Purchase\" category due to its direct implications for procurement processes and the tracking of purchased goods.\n\n**Determining Purchase Focus**\n\nI've thoroughly reviewed the ticket's details, and it's definitively about enhancing requisition approval workflows and cost visibility within Oracle Fusion. This clearly falls under the \"Purchase\" category, given its direct impact on procurement and tracking of purchased items.\n\n"
