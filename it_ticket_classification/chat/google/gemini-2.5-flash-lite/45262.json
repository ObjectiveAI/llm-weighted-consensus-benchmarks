The description mentions \"new survey error\" and \"something,\" which I'm analyzing against the available options: [\"Hardware\", \"HR Support\", \"Access \", \"Miscellaneous\", \"Storage\", \"Purchase\", \"Internal Project\", \"Administrative rights\"].\n\n**Refining IT Ticket Category**\n\nI'm narrowing down the most fitting category for the IT ticket. The \"new survey error\" and related details strongly suggest a software or application issue, pushing me away from hardware or HR-specific classifications. I'm leaning towards a more general category given the specific details.\n\n**Selecting Ticket Category**\n\nI'm currently evaluating the provided IT ticket description to assign the most accurate category. The details point towards a technical issue with a survey tool, specifically an error preventing submission due to duplicate values. After reviewing the available options, I'm leaning towards \"Miscellaneous\" as the best fit since no direct software or application category is present.\n\n**Choosing Ticket Category**\n\nI'm evaluating the ticket's technical error regarding survey submissions with duplicate values. Since no specific software or application category exists, I'm concluding that \"Miscellaneous\" is the most appropriate classification given the current options.\n\n**Classifying Ticket Issue**\n\nI'm currently refining my categorization for the IT ticket. The core of the problem involves a \"new survey error\" manifesting as \"duplicate values\" preventing users from submitting answers. Given the absence of a specific \"Software\" or \"Application\" category, and that the issue isn't hardware, HR, access, storage, purchase, project, or administrative rights related, I'm confirming \"Miscellaneous\" as the most suitable classification for this technical bug.\n\n"
