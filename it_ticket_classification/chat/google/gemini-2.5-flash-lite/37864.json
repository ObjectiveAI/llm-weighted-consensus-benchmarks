Based on my initial scan, the relevant keywords suggest \"Hardware\" might be the appropriate category. I'm exploring further for a definitive answer, and refining my criteria to differentiate between similar-sounding but distinct categories, like Hardware vs Storage. I'm also ensuring no other information changes this perspective.\n\n\n**Determining the Category**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's text, especially the recurring \"hardware data wipe\" theme, and examined relevant keywords such as \"hold\" and \"leaver ticket\". While there's a slight HR element due to the \"leaver\" context, the focus is clearly on the hardware's disposal. I'm now confident that \"Hardware\" is the correct category, given the primary action is related to hardware data wiping and management. I've ruled out other categories based on a close evaluation of the text.\n\n\n**Refining Category Selection**\n\nI'm now fully immersed in the nuances of this IT ticket. The \"hardware data wipe\" theme is indeed central, confirming \"Hardware\" as the most appropriate category. Though \"leaver ticket\" hints at HR involvement, the primary focus remains on hardware management and data sanitization. I've systematically ruled out other categories, carefully analyzing the text's core subject. This refined analysis solidifies \"Hardware\" as the definitive choice.\n\n\n"
