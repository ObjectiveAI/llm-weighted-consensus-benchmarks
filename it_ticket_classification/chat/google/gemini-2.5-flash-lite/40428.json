Initial analysis suggests access issues are prevalent, based on the text \"can access remotely.\" My thinking is now centered on weighing \"Access\" versus other categories to see which fits best.\n\n\n**Confirming Access Issues**\n\nI've honed in on the ticket's core problem: remote access issues and connection errors are primary, directly affecting client work. \"Can access remotely\" keeps popping up. Initial instinct to categorize as \"Access\" feels even more right after excluding options like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and others. My evaluation has resulted in a strong confirmation of this categorization.\n\n\n"
