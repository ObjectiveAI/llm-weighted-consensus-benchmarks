My focus is on identifying keywords that align with the available options: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. The phrase \"new purchase po\" strongly suggests the \"Purchase\" category.\n\n**Prioritizing Purchase Over Hardware**\n\nI've refined my focus and am now leaning towards categorizing the ticket under \"Purchase.\" While the mention of \"memory\" and \"installation\" initially pointed to \"Hardware,\" the repeated emphasis on \"purchase po\" and \"purchased\" strongly suggests the primary intent is related to the acquisition or ordering of the item, rather than its installation or maintenance.\n\n**Identifying Purchase Intent**\n\nI'm refining the categorization. The repeated mentions of \"purchase PO\" and \"purchased\" strongly indicate that the core of this request is about the acquisition process itself, or a specific purchase order, overriding the subsequent installation detail.\n\n**Refining Ticket Classification**\n\nI'm refining the categorization.
