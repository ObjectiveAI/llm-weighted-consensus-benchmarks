I'm also considering potential overlaps with \"Access\" if printer access is a factor.\n\n\n**Categorizing Printing Problems**\n\nI've refined my thinking, prioritizing \"Hardware\" as the primary category, given the concrete issues with malfunctioning sockets and tripping circuits. I acknowledge potential \"Access\" implications due to permission-related clues. However, the core issue is physical, leading me to focus on the hardware. The \"address change\" seems secondary to the electrical/hardware failures.\n\n\n**Determining Ticket Priority**\n\nI'm now prioritizing the ticket based on the details. While access might be a factor in printing/scanning not working, the physical hardware is the root cause. My analysis focuses on the malfunctioning sockets, tripped circuits, and extension cable. I'm focusing on the printing and scanning issues, recognizing they're likely caused by the underlying hardware failure.\n\n\n"
