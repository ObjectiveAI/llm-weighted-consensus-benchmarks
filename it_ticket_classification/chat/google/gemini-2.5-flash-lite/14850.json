I'm focusing on key terms to determine the most fitting category within the defined schema. \"Spark,\" \"room equipment,\" and \"teams\" seem to be key. I'm leaning toward \"Hardware,\" but I need to ensure it's not a misinterpretation of another category, such as \"HR Support\" if the spark relates to an employee.\n\n\n**Confirming Hardware Focus**\n\nI'm solidifying my approach, leaning strongly towards categorizing this as \"Hardware.\" The phrases \"room equipment\" and \"equipment issues\" are the primary indicators. While \"spark\" initially suggested a software component, the context consistently points to physical device issues. I'm focusing on the interplay between the \"spark\" setup and the malfunctioning equipment. This is a hardware problem.\n\n\n**Defining Hardware Category Focus**\n\nI'm now fully committed to the \"Hardware\" categorization. The ticket's emphasis on \"room equipment,\" \"equipment issues,\" and the general nature of device malfunction leaves little doubt. Even if \"spark\" represents a project, the core problem is related to the equipment's functionality, making hardware the most relevant category.\n\n\n"
