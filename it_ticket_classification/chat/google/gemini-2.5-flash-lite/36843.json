I've ruled out device malfunction as the phone itself is operational. My current focus is isolating whether it's an application issue, a network configuration problem, or a permission restriction that's hindering video functionality during meetings initiated from that particular conference room phone. The goal is to accurately categorize this.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Problem**\n\nI've determined the primary issue is hardware-related. The core of the problem lies with the video functionality of the conference room phone system in the Belgrade room.  Initial troubleshooting, based on the IT ticket's details, suggests the phone's hardware component is the culprit. Considering the options, this category is the most direct fit.\n\n\n"
