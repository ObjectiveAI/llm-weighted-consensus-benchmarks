The recurring mentions of \"change management dashboard\" and \"change dashboard\" are key indicators. I'm carefully weighing these terms against the predefined options to ensure an accurate classification. The user's goal is to accurately categorize based on provided text, considering things like requirements, building, and indicators, so I'm paying close attention to these details.\n\n\n**Analyzing The Category**\n\nI've determined \"Internal Project\" best fits the ticket's focus. The ticket details point toward the development of a \"change management dashboard,\" aligning perfectly with an internal initiative. I've ruled out other categories like hardware, HR support, access, and storage as they're clearly unrelated. The \"Miscellaneous\" category is too general, and \"Purchase\" isn't relevant.\n\n\n"
