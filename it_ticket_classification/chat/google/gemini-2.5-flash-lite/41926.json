Initial assessment suggests it leans towards \"Access\" issues, given the mention of login problems to a specific site. However, I'm cross-referencing this against other potential categories, like \"HR Support\" if the \"employment service site\" relates to employee-facing resources. I'll need to confirm the site's purpose.\n\n\n**Analyzing Access Issues Further**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the \"Access\" classification. The description of login trouble to the \"employment service site\" strongly suggests this is the primary issue. I've ruled out hardware problems and HR-related concerns, given the provided details. While administrative rights can sometimes be the root cause of access problems, the focus here is the login failure.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Root Cause**\n\nI've narrowed the focus, confirming the core issue is indeed an \"Access\" problem. The provided details, particularly the \"problem logging\" aspect, make this clear. The \"only pc\" detail strengthens this classification, indicating a specific user or device issue. I've now firmly excluded hardware malfunctions, HR concerns, and administrative rights as the primary issue here, as the problem is with accessing a website.\n\n\n"
