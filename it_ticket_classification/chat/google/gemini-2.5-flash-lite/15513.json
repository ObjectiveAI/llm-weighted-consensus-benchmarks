The keywords \"windows\" and \"install\" are leading me to strongly consider \"Hardware\" as the primary classification, though \"Internal Project\" remains a possibility depending on the broader context of the \"install\" action.\n\n**Assigning Ticket Category**\n\nI'm processing the input text, focusing on keywords like \"windows\" and \"install.\" My current analysis suggests this ticket most likely falls under the \"Hardware\" category, given the typical association of OS installation with IT infrastructure setup.\n\n**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm currently evaluating the provided text, focusing on the keywords \"windows\" and \"install.\" My analysis leads me to strongly consider \"Hardware\" as the most appropriate category for this IT ticket.\n\n**Processing Ticket Details**\n\nI'm currently analyzing the garbled text to extract the core IT request. My primary focus is on the keywords \"windows\" and \"install,\" which strongly suggest an operating system setup task. This leads me to believe \"Hardware\" is the most fitting category.\n\n"
