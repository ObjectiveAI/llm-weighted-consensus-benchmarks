This points strongly towards a hardware issue, possibly driver-related. I need to ensure this is truly a hardware problem and not a software or access issue.  The lack of context is hampering a definitive categorization.\n\n\n**Analyzing the Data**\n\nI've carefully dissected the provided text and identified key phrases like \"cannot install the printer\" and \"3rd floor printer.\" These elements strongly suggest the central problem revolves around printer functionality. The recurring issue, coupled with the mention of a specific printer model, strongly implies a hardware-related difficulty. Based on this analysis, \"Hardware\" is the most fitting category.\n\n\n"
