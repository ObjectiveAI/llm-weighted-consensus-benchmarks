My latest approach involves identifying the key phrases and their associated categories within the provided schema. Initial analysis suggests the ticket may fall under a few possible categories, but I'm still trying to narrow it down. The keywords \"planned work\" and \"upgrade\" are prominent, but don't provide a strong indication as to category.\n\n\n**Defining the Category**\n\nI've analyzed the ticket text in detail, breaking it down into key phrases and evaluating potential categories. My analysis indicates this is likely an \"Internal Project\" due to the emphasis on a \"planned upgrade\" and \"infrastructure engineer\". The ticket describes a planned infrastructure upgrade, which closely aligns with the characteristics of an internal project or a major maintenance activity. The phrases \"planned work\" and \"upgrade\" are the most indicative of this categorisation, when considering the limited scope of the ticket and absence of mention of Hardware, HR Support, Access, Storage, Purchase, and Administrative Rights.\n\n\n"
