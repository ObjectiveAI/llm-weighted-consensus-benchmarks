Keywords like \"leaver,\" \"leaving date,\" and \"leave\" strongly indicate that this ticket pertains to HR-related matters, specifically concerning employee departures. Therefore, I'm leaning towards categorizing it under \"HR Support.\"\n\n**Focusing on Offboarding Tasks**\n\nI'm sifting through the ticket details, noting terms like \"leaver,\" \"leaving date,\" and \"ad rights.\" These all point towards an employee's departure, suggesting that HR Support is the most appropriate category, encompassing the related access and inventory tasks.\n\n**Identifying Offboarding Context**\n\nI'm processing the latest ticket details, specifically noting terms like \"leaver service\" and \"leaver form.\" These phrases, alongside mentions of \"leaving date\" and access-related elements like \"ad rights\" and \"mailbox,\" solidify my initial assessment. The overarching theme of employee departure strongly suggests the \"HR Support\" category is the most fitting for this request, as it encompasses the entire offboarding workflow.\n\n"
