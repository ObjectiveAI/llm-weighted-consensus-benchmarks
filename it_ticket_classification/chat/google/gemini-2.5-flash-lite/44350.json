I've begun to analyze the text, \"for meetings links are not working externally\", and it seems to involve access or a potential network issue. I'm carefully considering the available categories - Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights - to determine the best fit for this particular issue. I'm leaning toward \"Access,\" but need to ensure it's the most accurate before making a final decision.\n\n\n**Defining the Problem's Core**\n\nI'm now focusing on pinpointing the root of the problem. I've re-examined the ticket details, particularly the \"certificate error\" for external users. This strengthens my belief that the issue revolves around access and connectivity for external clients trying to join meetings. My current thinking leans heavily toward an access-related category, given the nature of the error.\n\n\n**Confirming Access Issues**\n\nI'm solidifying my assessment. The persistent \"certificate error\" for external users is the key. I've ruled out hardware, HR, storage, purchase, internal projects, and admin rights. Access is the crux. The inability of external clients to join meetings, as explicitly stated, centers on access restrictions or connectivity failures.\n\n\n"
