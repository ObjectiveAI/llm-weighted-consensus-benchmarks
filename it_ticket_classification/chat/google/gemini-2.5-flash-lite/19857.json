So far, the provided text seems to involve user management and mailbox access. I'm leaning toward either \"Access\" or potentially \"HR Support,\" but I'm still weighing the nuances to decide definitively.\n\n\n**Finalizing the Classification**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's content, focusing on terms like \"mailbox,\" \"access,\" and \"granting.\" While \"HR Support\" could be relevant for new user setup, the details point more directly to \"Access\" \u2013 this seems more fitting for mailbox access, caller list modifications, and granting permissions. I'm now confident in this choice.\n\n\n"
