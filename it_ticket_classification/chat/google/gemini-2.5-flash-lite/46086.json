The user's input indicates a connectivity issue, and I'm weighing whether it leans towards a hardware problem, access restriction, or perhaps a more general connectivity issue that could be classified as miscellaneous. Given the explicit mention of an inability to connect, I'm leaning towards focusing on \"Access\". I'm also considering context clues, but that is secondary.\n\n\n**Defining Access Issue**\n\nI've honed in on \"Access\" as the prime category. The user's repeated emphasis on being \"unable to connect\" and receiving connection-related error messages solidifies this. I ruled out other options like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and \"Miscellaneous\" due to their lack of direct relevance to the connection difficulties described. Now, I'm focusing on refining the specific type of access issue \u2013 network, system, application, or account \u2013 based on any further implicit clues in the ticket.\n\n\n**Narrowing Access Type**\n\nI've confirmed that \"Access\" is the correct categorization. The recurring theme of connection failure and the explicit error message point directly towards an access problem. Now, I'm analyzing the description more deeply to determine the *type* of access issue. I need to pinpoint whether this is a network access problem, an application access problem, or something else. I'm looking for clues about the specific system or service the user is trying to reach.\n\n\n"
