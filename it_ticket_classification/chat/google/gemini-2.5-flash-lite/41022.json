The details of the ticket point towards a potential hardware issue \u2013 specifically, a wireless driver malfunction. Considering the user needs a driver fix or reinstallation, I am leaning toward \"Hardware\" as the most appropriate category. I'm moving forward with this assessment.\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nMy focus remains on categorizing the IT ticket. After a close review of the ticket text, the \"wireless driver not working\" issue continues to suggest a \"Hardware\" problem, and not one falling under any of the other categories in the provided list. Therefore, I maintain this assessment and will move forward with the \"Hardware\" label as the most appropriate category for this particular IT support request.\n\n\n"
