While there are access concerns, the primary issue appears related to viewing files. I'm leaning toward \"Access\" or \"Storage,\" but the wording is a bit ambiguous. I will consider \"Access\" as the primary category.\n\n\n**Revising Category Choice**\n\nAfter reviewing the ticket again, the initial instinct of \"Access\" still stands strong. While \"Storage\" remains a possibility, the user's inability to *view* the images on the shared drive, even with existing permissions, leans towards an access or network-related problem. I believe the core issue is getting the images to display correctly.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket's text, focusing on the \"cannot view without downloading\" detail. While I initially considered \"Storage,\" the need to download files to view them strongly suggests an Access-related problem. I believe the core issue is how the user's computer interacts with the shared drive, likely a network or client-side configuration. \"Access\" feels the most apt category to reflect this interaction.\n\n\n"
