After reviewing the provided description, \"write access\" seems pivotal. I'm leaning toward \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" as the ticket details concern actions that align with these categories. I'll need to confirm that this is not a hardware, HR, or other unrelated issue.\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nI've narrowed the ticket's category down to \"Access.\" The key is \"write access\" and subsequent actions like uploading and adding events, which clearly point to permission-based issues. \"Administrative rights\" is a possibility but feels too specific. I'm confident \"Access\" is the most fitting, general choice. This aligns with the ticket's focus.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've examined the ticket description. It centers around \"write access,\" which governs document uploads and event additions. The phrase \"can only add we\" doesn't change the focus on permissions. I'm choosing \"Access\" as the fitting category, as it directly encapsulates the grant of permissions.\n\n\n"
