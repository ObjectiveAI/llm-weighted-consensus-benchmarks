Right now, I'm leaning toward \"Miscellaneous\" based on keywords like \"surveys\" and \"reminder.\" However, I need to consider other categories. My goal is to ensure the solution accurately identifies the most likely category based on the ticket text, even with ambiguous terms. I plan to refine this logic and integrate it with more test data.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Category Assignment**\n\nI've just solidified my approach by choosing \"Miscellaneous.\" The ticket's content, encompassing \"surveys,\" \"reminder,\" \"daily discussions,\" and \"incidents requests,\" leans heavily toward internal communication rather than a specific technical issue. This choice prioritizes general communication, making \"Miscellaneous\" the optimal and encompassing category, given the lack of specific, well-defined technical issues from the text.\n\n\n"
