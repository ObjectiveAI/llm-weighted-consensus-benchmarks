For instance, I might propose: Strongly agree 0.12, Agree 0.38, Disagree 0.33, Strongly disagree 0.17, which sums to 1.0.**Estimating poll percentages**\n\nI'm estimating that around 50% would agree that their country is ruled by the will of the people, combining \"Agree\" and \"Strongly agree,\" while the other 50% would disagree, possibly leaning towards more disagreement. For example, I could suggest 10% for \"Strongly agree,\" 45% for \"Agree,\" 15% for \"Strongly disagree,\" and 30% for \"Disagree.\" The final output must be in JSON format under the \"results\" type, so no commentary is necessary; just the numbers will suffice.**Producing final JSON**\n\nThe system guidelines say to avoid heavy formatting unless explicitly requested, but I need to provide a JSON response. I\u2019ll go with my estimates: Strongly agree at 0.12, Agree at 0.33, Disagree at 0.33, and Strongly disagree at 0.22. This sums perfectly to 1.0, which represents 45% agreeing and 55% disagreeing. It\u2019s plausible given that various global surveys show low faith in government. I\u2019ll ensure to stick to the specified schema. Here\u2019s the JSON!"

These percentages should sum to 1 and remain between 0 and 1. I\u2019m thinking about plausible global distribution, possibly using global democracy indices or public opinion surveys like Gallup World Poll. In democracies, I can estimate around 30-40% might agree or strongly agree, but dissatisfaction exists too. So maybe something like: Strongly Agree 0.20, Agree 0.30; Disagree 0.28, Strongly Disagree 0.22. Just weighing if people might disagree more globally.**Determining response estimates**\n\nI remember that Pew has a global median showing 41% satisfied and 45% dissatisfied, indicating a slight majority are dissatisfied. Gallup's 2020 data found about 36% of adults feeling satisfied. For the statement about being \"ruled by the will of the people,\" I\u2019m proposing a combined \"agree\" percentage of 0.44: with Strongly Agree at 0.12 and Agree at 0.32, while Disagree comes to 0.56 overall. Final output needs to strictly follow the JSON format, focusing on the required keys and numerical values between 0 and 1.**Creating result percentages**\n\nThe results schema is crucial, so I need to produce the JSON output correctly. I\u2019ll select plausible percentages for the categories: Strongly Agree at 0.14, Agree at 0.30 for a combined 0.44; Disagree and Strongly Disagree could be 0.28 each, totaling 0.56. Or I might choose 0.33 for Disagree and 0.23 for Strongly Disagree\u2014both give the same total. I want to reflect some balance and polarization, aiming for Moderate responses. I'll finalize with Strongly Agree at 0.12 and Agree at 0.32, ensuring everything sums to 1.0, formatted properly."
