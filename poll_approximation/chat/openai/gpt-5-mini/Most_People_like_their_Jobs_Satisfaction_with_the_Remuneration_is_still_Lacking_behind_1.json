I should base my estimates on known surveys, like Gallup's global workplace reports, which indicate around 20-21% are engaged, suggesting they feel satisfied. However, historically, job satisfaction levels have been higher, with OECD data showing about 75% satisfaction in 2015. I'll need to keep these factors in mind.**Estimating job satisfaction metrics**\n\nI realize that engagement and satisfaction are different measures. The World Values Survey can provide insights, though satisfaction levels may be lower in low-income countries. I need to create a plausible estimate for global job satisfaction and provide a distribution that sums to 1. I'm proposing: \n\n- Very satisfied: 0.18 \n- Somewhat satisfied: 0.36 \n- Neither: 0.15 \n- Somewhat dissatisfied: 0.18 \n- Very dissatisfied: 0.13 \n\nThis gives us 54% total satisfaction, which seems reasonable, possibly closer to 60%. I need to format this as a JSON object and clarify if I should include a brief note.**Formatting the results**\n\nI need to focus on the format required for the results, which is a JSON object. While there\u2019s no specific restriction on extra text, I need to keep it minimal and follow the schema strictly. The values I\u2019m considering should align with known data, like Gallup's 2023 report indicating about 52% are either very or somewhat satisfied. \n\nI\u2019ll go with the earlier distribution and ensure the keys match exactly, using decimals with at most two places. I'll produce the final JSON output now."
