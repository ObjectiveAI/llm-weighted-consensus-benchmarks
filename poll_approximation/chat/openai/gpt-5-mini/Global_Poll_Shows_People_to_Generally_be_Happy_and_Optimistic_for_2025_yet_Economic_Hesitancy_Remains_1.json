Polls typically show around 30-40% believing it will be \"better,\" while 20-30% say it will be \"worse,\" with the rest feeling it will be \"the same.\" I'll suggest a possible distribution with Better at 0.36, Worse at 0.30, and The Same at 0.34. This seems plausible, reflecting a balanced global mood post-COVID and inflation.**Finalizing poll results**\n\nI\u2019m deciding on the final percentages for the poll results. Initially, I considered using values of 0.36 for Better, 0.30 for Worse, and 0.34 for The Same. However, I now think a better distribution would be Better at 0.35, Worse at 0.28, and The Same at 0.37. This seems plausible and stays within the 0-1 range.
