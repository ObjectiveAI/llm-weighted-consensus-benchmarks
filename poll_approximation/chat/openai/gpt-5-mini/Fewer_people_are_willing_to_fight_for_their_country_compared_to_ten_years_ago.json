This global estimate must consider demographics and factors like nationalism, age, and political views. While I usually consider undecided responses, the format only allows for Yes and No, so I should be cautious. After weighing these factors, I'm thinking around 55% Yes and 45% No could be a reasonable estimate.**Refining willingness estimates**\n\nI need to consider realism in global willingness to fight, noting that many countries lean towards low responses. Pew polls indicate that willingness tends to be higher in authoritarian states and lower in Western democracies, so a global average might sit around 50%. Historical data shows a range of about 30-60%. For my JSON object, I\u2019ll adjust the numbers to Yes: 0.53 and No: 0.47, suggesting that 53% would be willing, which feels reasonable within this context.**Choosing percentage estimates**\n\nI\u2019m refining my numbers for the willingness to fight. Initially, I consider a conservative estimate of 50% for both Yes and No, but I realize I should present distinct figures instead. After some thought, I settle on Yes at 0.52 and No at 0.48. I\u2019ll ensure the output is structured correctly as a JSON object with the exact keys needed. So, the final output will be: {\"Yes\":0.52,\"No\":0.48}. That feels like a good choice!"
