I recall key scenes and character interactions to pinpoint the individual who expresses this feeling. The process of elimination is key here.\n\n\n**Confirming Snaut's Shame**\n\n\\n\\n\n\nI've carefully examined the provided options. The reasoning in option E, explicitly linking Snaut to shame about simple pleasures and rustling leaves, appears accurate. I'm now certain that Snaut is the correct answer and will confirm this through a final check of the key scenes. The other options seem to misidentify the character in question.\n\n\n**Pinpointing Character Justification**\n\n\\n\\n\n\nI've sifted through the options and focused on the justifications provided. The detailed reasoning supporting Snaut in option F clinches it for me, as does E.  The evidence from the film, as described in F, aligns precisely with my recollection of Snaut's character and his longing for Earth. I'm now certain of the solution.\n\n\n",
