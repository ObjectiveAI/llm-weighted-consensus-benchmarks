But I'm unsure about 7 and 8. For n=8, I see possibilities like 20*20=400 or 112*4=448. Also, dimension 7 may yield 224 using 112*2. \\n\\nFor dimension 8, I could get 448 again with previously mentioned products. However, options like 496 or 512 might be unreachable with these numbers.

I've pinpointed that the lower bound for the size of cap sets in dimension 8, denoted as r_3(8), is at least 496. This seems to be consistent across several sources I've reviewed, based on direct computation or specific constructions.
