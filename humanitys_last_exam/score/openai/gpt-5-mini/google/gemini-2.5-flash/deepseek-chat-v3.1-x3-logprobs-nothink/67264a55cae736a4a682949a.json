I\\u2019m trying to reason through how the incidence rate ratio in trials could lead to bias due to depletion of susceptibles.**Understanding per-exposure vaccine efficacy**\\n\\nI\\u2019m working out that the per-exposure vaccine efficacy (VE) equals p, where p represents the fraction of individuals protected. In trials, they measure the incidence rate ratio over a follow-up period. Given that some vaccinated individuals are fully protected while others aren't, this can influence the incidence ratio. There may be issues related to the depletion of susceptibles, leading to potential bias in the calculations. After considering this, it seems that 1 minus the incidence rate ratio accurately estimates the per-exposure VE.**Examining vaccine efficacy over time**\\n\\nI need to be cautious about how vaccine efficacy might decrease or affect measurements over a long period. If there's an \\\"all-or-nothing\\\" effect, the susceptible proportion in the unvaccinated group could diminish faster than in the vaccinated group over time. When calculating the rates, I see that the vaccinated group has a fraction p that is protected and a (1-p) fraction that remains susceptible. \\n\\nThe overall hazard for the vaccinated group evolves over time, and this requires careful consideration of the incidence rate and person-time at risk, especially for those already infected.**Analyzing incidence rates in unvaccinated groups**\\n\\nI'm considering the hazard constant \\u03bb for susceptible individuals, particularly in the unvaccinated group where the susceptible fraction starts at 1 and declines as infections occur. However, I must remember that individuals are excluded from the risk set once they become infected. The incidence rate during follow-up is \\u03bb for those still susceptible. \\n\\nI need to ensure that when I calculate rates for the vaccinated group, I'm only counting individuals still at risk. Ultimately, the incidence rate depends on the proportion of susceptible individuals over time.**Calculating incidence rates in vaccinated groups**\\n\\nI'm trying to evaluate how the incidence rate reflects the events over person-time for both unvaccinated and vaccinated groups. For unvaccinated individuals, the expected incidence rate works out to \\u03bb, while for vaccinated individuals, the incidence rate is impacted by the protected fraction, which contributes zero events. This means the overall ratio is likely to underestimate the true per-exposure vaccine efficacy.

This type of vaccine provides full protection to a fraction of the population (p), while others remain susceptible. The per-exposure vaccine efficacy is often defined as 1 minus the relative risk of infection upon exposure. For all-or-nothing, per-exposure efficacy equals p since protected individuals have zero risk. The IRR is based on incidence in vaccinated versus unvaccinated individuals.**Estimating vaccine efficacy**\\n\\nFor an all-or-nothing vaccine, the vaccinated group includes a fraction (p) that is fully protected with zero incidence, and a fraction (1-p) that has the same infection rate as the unvaccinated. This means the incidence in the vaccinated equals (1-p) times the incidence in the unvaccinated. Consequently, the incidence rate ratio (IRR) becomes (1-p), leading to 1 - IRR equaling p, which measures per-exposure vaccine efficacy. \\n\\nThus, 1 - IRR correctly estimates this efficacy.

It\\u2019s crucial to consider how this relates to the overall incidence seen in vaccinated groups based on the cumulative incidence among unvaccinated individuals and the fraction that remains unprotected. My goal is to think this through clearly.**Clarifying per-exposure VE**\\n\\nI'm considering how per-exposure vaccine efficacy (VE) is defined as the probability of infection among vaccinated versus unvaccinated individuals. For an all-or-nothing vaccine, the average probability reflects those who are fully protected and those who aren't. This leads to the per-exposure VE being equal to the fraction that is protected.

I\\u2019m trying to reason through how the incidence rate ratio in trials could lead to bias due to depletion of susceptibles.**Understanding per-exposure vaccine efficacy**\\n\\nI\\u2019m working out that the per-exposure vaccine efficacy (VE) equals p, where p represents the fraction of individuals protected. In trials, they measure the incidence rate ratio over a follow-up period. Given that some vaccinated individuals are fully protected while others aren't, this can influence the incidence ratio. There may be issues related to the depletion of susceptibles, leading to potential bias in the calculations. After considering this, it seems that 1 minus the incidence rate ratio accurately estimates the per-exposure VE.**Examining vaccine efficacy over time**\\n\\nI need to be cautious about how vaccine efficacy might decrease or affect measurements over a long period. If there's an \\\"all-or-nothing\\\" effect, the susceptible proportion in the unvaccinated group could diminish faster than in the vaccinated group over time. When calculating the rates, I see that the vaccinated group has a fraction p that is protected and a (1-p) fraction that remains susceptible. \\n\\nThe overall hazard for the vaccinated group evolves over time, and this requires careful consideration of the incidence rate and person-time at risk, especially for those already infected.**Analyzing incidence rates in unvaccinated groups**\\n\\nI'm considering the hazard constant \\u03bb for susceptible individuals, particularly in the unvaccinated group where the susceptible fraction starts at 1 and declines as infections occur. However, I must remember that individuals are excluded from the risk set once they become infected. The incidence rate during follow-up is \\u03bb for those still susceptible. \\n\\nI need to ensure that when I calculate rates for the vaccinated group, I'm only counting individuals still at risk. Ultimately, the incidence rate depends on the proportion of susceptible individuals over time.**Calculating incidence rates in vaccinated groups**\\n\\nI'm trying to evaluate how the incidence rate reflects the events over person-time for both unvaccinated and vaccinated groups. For unvaccinated individuals, the expected incidence rate works out to \\u03bb, while for vaccinated individuals, the incidence rate is impacted by the protected fraction, which contributes zero events. This means the overall ratio is likely to underestimate the true per-exposure vaccine efficacy. I need to ensure I explain this clearly, focusing on how protected individuals inflate person-time without contributing to event counts, leading to bias in the results.\",\n  \"answer\": \"A. Overestimate. For an all-or-nothing vaccine a fraction p is fully protected and contributes person-time without events, which reduces the observed incidence rate in the vaccinated arm more than the per-exposure susceptibility reduction p.

Clarifying implications is ongoing.\\n\\n\\n**Defining Vaccine Impact**\\n\\nThe key takeaway is that 1-IRR represents the *proportion* of individuals who achieve full protection with the vaccine. This value differs from the actual per-exposure efficacy, which is 100% *for those protected*. The 1-IRR underestimates the per-exposure efficacy. I'm focusing on refining this point.\\n\\n\\n\",\n  \"answer\": \"For an all-or-nothing vaccine, the vaccination either confers perfect (100%) protection to an individual or no protection (0%) at all. The 1-incidence rate ratio (IRR) estimates the proportion of vaccinated individuals who achieve full protection (let's call this proportion 'p'). If 'p' is less than 1 (meaning not all vaccinated individuals are fully protected), then the 1-IRR value (which is 'p') will be less than 100%. Since the per-exposure vaccine efficacy for those individuals who are protected is 100%, and the 1-IRR provides a value 'p' which is typically less than 100%, the 1-IRR will generally underestimate the per-exposure vaccine efficacy for those who are protected.\",\n  \"answer_letter\": \"B\"\n}",
