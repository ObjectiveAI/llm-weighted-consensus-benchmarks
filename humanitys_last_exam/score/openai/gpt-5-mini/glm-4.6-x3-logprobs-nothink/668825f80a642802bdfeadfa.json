The choices are Egalitarian Dominance, General Non-Extreme Priority, Non-Elitism, Weak Non-Sadism, and Weak Quality Addition. I need to think about what critical-level views might violate. It seems critical-level utilitarianism could potentially clash with General Non-Extreme Priority, which prioritizes the worse off but isn't extreme. Non-Elitism might also apply. Let's recall definitions like Weak Non-Sadism\\u2014wouldn't want to add individuals with negative welfare. I remember there's an Arrhenius theorem about six conditions in population ethics.**Analyzing critical-level views**\\n\\nI'm trying to figure out which condition critical-level views might violate. It could be Non-Elitism, but I want to be precise. I remember that classical utilitarianism violates \\\"Non-Extreme Priority\\\" because it treats everyone equally, not prioritizing the worse off. Critical-level utilitarianism might breach \\\"Weak Non-Sadism,\\\" as it could suggest adding lives with negative welfare if they surpass a critical level. For critical level c, adding someone with welfare x gives positive value if x > c, but could prevent adding those below c, which is quite controversial.**Evaluating critical-level utilitarianism**\\n\\nSo, critical-level utilitarianism could let us add a life with negative welfare if x - c is greater than zero, meaning x must exceed c. If welfare is negative, then it can't be greater than c if c is positive, suggesting it wouldn't allow adding negative-welfare lives. If c is negative, though, that might change things. Weak Quality Addition implies that adding a life with positive welfare should improve the overall value. If c is positive and we add someone with welfare below c, it could violate Weak Quality Addition.**Analyzing critical-level utilitarianism**\\n\\nIn critical-level utilitarianism, if c is positive, adding a person with welfare x (where x > 0 but x < c) might be seen as a negative impact. Regarding Weak Non-Sadism, it seems okay since it wouldn't allow adding someone with negative welfare if c is less than or equal to zero. Non-Elitism suggests we shouldn't make some people worse off to help others. For Egalitarian Dominance, if the average welfare is above c, it might violate that condition. Also, I believe critical-level views violate Weak Quality Addition.**Finalizing the response on critical-level theories**\\n\\nCritical-level theories can view the addition of a life with positive total welfare as negative if that welfare falls below the critical level. The principle of Weak Quality Addition asserts that adding someone with positive welfare should improve overall well-being. Many philosophers argue against critical-level views for failing to honor the intuition that adding a life with positive welfare is always beneficial.
