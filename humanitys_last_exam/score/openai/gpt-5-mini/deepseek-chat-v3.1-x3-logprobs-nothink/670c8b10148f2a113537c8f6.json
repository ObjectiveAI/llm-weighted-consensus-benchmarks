It looks like if I multiply dimension 1 (2) and dimension 6 (112), I get 224 for n=7. Dimension 8 might relate back to other calculations, but I\\u2019m still figuring it out!**Searching for maximum caps**\\n\\nI'm looking into known maximum caps for various dimensions: 1 is 2, 2 is 4, 3 is 9, 4 is 20, 5 is 45, and 6 is 112. But I'm unsure about 7 and 8. For n=8, I see possibilities like 20*20=400 or 112*4=448. Also, dimension 7 may yield 224 using 112*2. \\n\\nFor dimension 8, I could get 448 again with previously mentioned products. However, options like 496 or 512 might be unreachable with these numbers. I wonder if the best lower bound for n=8 could actually be 512.**Examining maximal cap sizes**\\n\\nI\\u2019m considering the maximal cap sizes for F_3^n up to dimension 8.

There\\u2019s work by Edel and Bierbrauer that covers up to dimension 6 or 7. I recall 344 as a potential lower bound for n=7, though I\\u2019m uncertain. \\n\\nUsing combinations, I see 256 being achievable through 4 copies of dimension 2 caps, which is less than both 400 and 448. I'm curious if there are known caps of size 512, but 256 comes from 2^8, not 2^9. So, I\\u2019m left wondering about producing 512 using products.**Exploring cap size possibilities**\\n\\nI'm considering whether we can reach a cap size of 512 using a size of 16 in dimension 8. Maybe there are more complex constructions that could create larger sets. If dimension 7 has a known cap of around 256, then doubling that would yield 512 for dimension 8.

It seems plausible that for n=8, the previous values multiply out, but I\\u2019m curious if a better construction actually yields 496 instead of 448. I also want to confirm projective caps in relation to sizes too.**Assessing caps for m8**\\n\\nI\\u2019m working through the idea that if m4=20, then it seems m8 should be at least 400, with options like 496, 512, and 224. I'm trying to think if better direct constructions may yield 512, especially since that's 2^9. I wonder if it\\u2019s possible to use products of sizes for caps.

Either way, I wonder about the possibility of a cap size of 16 in dimension 8, though that seems trivial. I remember some results about maximal caps in AG(n,3), like m(6)=112 and m(7)=224.

The main question is about the best-known lower bound for their size, with possible sizes like 224, 16, 512, 80, 45, and 496. For F_3^8, the total number of points is 6561. I need to recall some known maximal cap sizes for different dimensions, though I might be mixing terms between affine and vector spaces here.**Assessing cap set sizes**\\n\\nI\\u2019m trying to recall literature on cap sets sizes: for n=4, I think the cap size might be 20, and for n=6, it could be 112. The options to consider are 224, 512, 496, 80, 45, or 16. I\\u2019m pondering whether 512, being 2^9, is relevant, or if 496 is close to 729 (3^6). Maybe the question focuses on Hamming code caps or the product of caps? Overall, I\\u2019m trying to establish what the best known lower bound really is for dimension 8. It seems like 512 might be too small given the total points of 6561.**Recalling maximal cap sizes**\\n\\nI'm piecing together known maximal cap sizes for small n values in F_3: for n=1, it's 2; for n=2, it's 4; for n=3, I believe it\\u2019s 9 due to a 3x3 grid. For n=4, I think the maximal cap size is around 20. I recall a sequence, A003000, which lists these caps as: 2, 4, 9, 20, 45, 112. For n=7, I\\u2019m not sure, but for n=8, 224 seems plausible, possibly derived from a doubling formula for even n.**Exploring cap size multiplication**\\n\\nI\\u2019m considering how cap sizes might multiply by 2 when increasing dimensions using product constructions. If there's a cap of size a in F_3^n and b in F_3^m, the product would yield ab in F_3^{n+m}. For example, if the maximal cap size for n=6 is 112 and for n=2 is 4, then multiplying gives 448 for n=8, but that's not an option. However, if n=4 is 20, then 20 times 20 equals 400. I\\u2019m wondering if I can use a doubling approach based on previous sizes, suggesting that for n=7, the max might be 224, achieved through multiplication by 2.**Determining the best lower bound**\\n\\nThe expected answer might be 224, but for dimension 8, is it 512 instead? The upper candidates above 256 are 512 and 496. Since a trivial construction of size 256 exists, any lower bound must be \\u2265256, eliminating options below that like 224. Plausibly, the best lower bound could be 512 or 496. It seems 448 arises from known maximal caps, so I\\u2019m concluding the best-known lower bound for dimension 8 is at least 448.**Choosing the plausible answer**\\n\\nIt seems like the closest options are 496 and 512, but since 448 is less than 496, I can't consider 496 a valid lower bound without proof. The likely answer might be 224, but I\\u2019m exploring the context\\u2014dimension 8 in projective space, perhaps? \\n\\nWhile I previously deduced that products yield 448, it might be true that the maximal known cap for dimension 8 is indeed 512. There might be constructions yielding that size.
