However, I wonder if some can still show optical activity through gyration tensors, even with symmetry centers. It seems like optical activity, or gyrotropy, comes from the antisymmetric part of dielectric susceptibility. I need to recall that \\u201ccrystalline optical activity\\u201d can exist in certain classes that lack specific symmetry. Let me dig deeper into some textbooks to clarify this further!**Clarifying optical concepts**\\n\\nI\\u2019m thinking about \\\"optical rotary power,\\\" which relies on the antisymmetric part of the dielectric tensor. Non-centrosymmetric classes can exhibit piezoelectricity, but many other classes, even some achiral ones, allow for optical activity. I want more clarity on how the gyration tensor functions\\u2014does it act like an axial second rank tensor? I remember that natural optical activity needs a lack of improper rotations or mirror planes, so only chiral point groups can support it. Yet, some non-chiral classes can still show activity along the optic axis. Let's dig deeper into the specifics of these classes!**Examining polar and achiral groups**\\n\\nI'm working through polar point groups: 1, 2, m, mm2, 3, 3m, 4, 4mm, 6, and 6mm. I need to find which options describe achiral and non-polar classes that support optical activity. For option E (1, 2, 3, 4, and 6), those are polar and chiral groups, so they're not the right choice. Now looking at option A (m and mm2), m has a mirror plane, making it achiral, but is it actually polar? I should double-check the definitions again for clarity!**Analyzing polar and achiral groups**\\n\\nI've concluded that point group m is polar because it can have a polar axis within its mirror plane. Since m and mm2 are both polar, they cannot be the options I want. Now moving to option C (3m, 4m, 6mm), which also contains polar groups due to the mirror planes. I suspect 4m is shorthand for 4mm, but that makes it invalid for my needs. Lastly, for option B (-6, -62m, -43m), it looks like -6 (or 6 bar) is centrosymmetric, which means it's achiral. I'm digging deeper into these groups!**Determining achiral and nonpolar groups**\\n\\nI'm sorting through some point groups to see which are achiral and non-polar. I know that -43m includes mirror planes and improper rotations, which might mean it could be achiral and non-polar. Option B features groups like -6 and -62m, and I think those might fit, but I want to double-check their standard naming. Meanwhile, option D has -4 and -42m, which could be achiral too. I really need to figure out which of these groups can allow optical activity, focusing on their symmetry properties!**Finalizing the answer on optical activity**\\n\\nI remember that the S4 group (\\\\bar{4}) is optically active, often producing rotation around the fourfold axis. I'm curious if \\\\bar{4}2m shares this trait. I\\u2019ve noted that achiral but optically active groups typically have rotoreflection or inversion axes of even order, which could include -4 and -42m.

To be optically active, the crystal classes can't have a mirror plane perpendicular to the optical axis.
