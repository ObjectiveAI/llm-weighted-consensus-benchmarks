# llm-weighted-consensus-benchmarks

We believe that llm-weighted-consensus is a production-ready system which enables novel applications of LLMs as well as the application of LLMs into domains which would not be otherwise feasible.

This repository contains verifiable & reproducible benchmarks which attempt to prove:
- llm-weighted-consensus increases LLM correctness (and, arguably, intelligence)
- llm-weighted-consensus increases LLM reliability
- llm-weighted-consensus decreases LLM cost

Each directory wthin the repository contains a script for running the benchmark, the results of the benchmark, and a writeup for the results.
